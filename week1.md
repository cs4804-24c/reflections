This link contains the visualization breakdown of popular Disney/Pixar films and the percentage of dialogue voiced by male-identifying characters versus female characters. I am the prime example of a Disney adult, primarily due to my raising my younger siblings through the magic and nostalgia of these films. It is interesting and impactful to note the evolution of the scripts written for many of these Disney movies because as the release dates become more and more recent, the balance of the male-to-female dialogue also meets more of an equilibrium. I chose this visualization because it felt important for me to understand the growth of feminism in films targeted toward a younger audience, so my younger siblings (both male and female) can better understand the social dynamics needed for success and equality. An interesting contrast among the movies in the visualization is that there are several outliers for movies with more prominent female dialogue, as well as those with female lead characters and still a dialogue imbalance. The visualization is a simple one, without color gradients or fancy geometry overlays. However, the significance of its quality is the shadows and shading with a few lines and font choices that are subtle but change how the viewer interprets the data. When scrolling through the website, the visualization drastically and dramatically transitions to much more complex and even beautifully overlaps the article beneath it. Finally, the visualization scroll ends with a gradient where upon cursor hovering there will display a movie name and the male-female split percentage of dialogue in a certain movie--depending on where the cursor is hovering on the bar. The transition from simple to more complicated visualizations on this page were very interesting and caught my attention as data that I had never thought about before viewing this page.
