Sankey diagrams are types of visualizations that are used to depict a flow from one set of values to another set of values. The connections are called the links and the things that are being connected are the nodes. This visualization is the 2023 income and spending of a 3 person family in French. This Sankey diagram provides a comprehensive visualization of the financial aspect of a family’s life in the year 2023. At the left side of the diagram, we can see the husband’s and wife wage, any refunds, financial support and savings. On the right side, we have the expenses such as water consumption, electricity, loan payments, mobile expenses, taxes and also the savings for the year 2024. The width of the arrows represents the relative amounts of money flowing between the different categories. As the arrow is wider, the amount of money allocated to the particular category is larger. So, the breakdown of incomes provides a view of where the income is directed. In conclusion, the Sankey diagram can be used as a valuable tool for financial analysis and planning by guiding families and individuals making informed decisions about financial planning. For improvements, adjusting the color scheme and rearranging the order of categories in a specific order can be recommended.
