It is important to see how people across the world spend their time. This distribution can provide a brief view of the general living conditions, as well as how gender parity continues to affect countries around the world. I find the interactive-ness of the visualization to be extremely helpful, without being repetitive. For instance, if you hover over a country's dot, which shows the population, specific numbers for men's and women's leisure time come out. Additionally, the legend of continents gets activated, and a population comparison to the largest population is automatically done. However, the visualization is limited by a lack of data for certain continents. There is also a lot of congestion in certain points, in which only certain countries are labeled. For future work, I wonder if a sort of zoom-in option, or selection of a certain area of the visualization to look into would be plausible.
