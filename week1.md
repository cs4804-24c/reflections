This animated data visualization was published by The New York Times to show how based on your gender and race the likeliness of income mobility if you were raised by a poor family. The data visualization that’s pictured in this article compares the lives of 50,000 American Black and White women. It demonstrates although Black and White women have similar individual earnings, they do not have the same household incomes. In fact, White Women tend to have higher household incomes. I think this is a good visualization and it highlights differences and similarities between groups well. The colors chosen for the visualization are distinct enough to be able to track the different dots on the screen. I also like the way it’s designed so that you can visually see how the people that are poor are at the bottom and the people that are getting richer move up the graph. I enjoy that it is an animated visualization so the viewer can actually “follow” the dots or perhaps the life of an individual person and see if they rise in economic status. I would have preferred a bolder color or a different way to display the labels such as “poor adult” and “lower middle class adult” since it does get harder to read them as more dots pile in. Ultimately, visualizations like these could be use to promote policies that can help Americans achieve economic mobility and move out of poverty.
