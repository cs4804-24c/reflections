One of the data visualizations that I found this week was created by user [u/makella_](https://www.reddit.com/user/makella_/) over on [r/dataisbeautiful](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/191nvy8/oc_the_us_is_the_biggest_cornnoisseur_in_the/). 
The map below was made with Felt Maps, and shows the Top 20 crops grown in the United States by acerage.

From a quick glance at the entire United States, it's pretty clear that Corn is the our most widely produced crop, with other crops like soybeans and cotton being the most prevalent in certain regions. This
data seems to have been gathered from https://nassgeodata.gmu.edu/CropScape/, which honestly paints the same picture. The only real difference seems to be the style of the map of the United States itself.

A quick glance at the map also shows just how large the Untied States is, as a large majority of the East/Middle of the US is seemingly empty, with cities and areas of population only taking up so much of 
the blank areas. Zooming in additionally allows for some cool visualizations, as we can see how the road network in Southern Texas clearly separates some fields:

An apparent limitation of this site is that it most likely very roughly clumps the fields togeher, and as a result, seems that it can be easy to miss a ton of areas until you really zoom in. For example, New
Mexico from a look in the first image practically shows nothing, while subsequent zoom-ins show fields along the roads, as well as pretty clear cut field shapes:

A closer zoom-in just Southeast of Albuquerque:

Locating the same area on Google Maps shows that they really do have these circular crop fields:
