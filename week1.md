Visualization Reflection:

In TheUpshot article, "In Reversal Because of AI, Office Jobs Are Now More At Risk", author Claire Cain Miller discusses the future impacts that AI developments could have on the security of certain white-collar jobs. The article features a horizontal bar chart titled "College-Educated Workers Are Most Exposed to AI," which provides an OpenAI estimation of the median percentage share of tasks of all occupations in each required education category that could be assisted by artificial intelligence tools. First, I agree with the presentation of this data through a horizontal bar chart since bar charts are best suited to represent categorical variables. Second, I agree with the choice for each category to be a certain level of required education for the encompassing occupations; it makes sense to estimate the median percentage share of tasks of all occupations that could be assisted by artificial intelligence through dividing those job tasks by required education level. With that being said, there are two assigned labels for these categories that I disagree with, which are the "High school diploma or less" and "High school diploma" categories. These two categories should be distinct with no overlap of required education level, and so to improve these two category labels, I would relabel the first one as "Less formal education than high school diploma" and the second one as "High school diploma". To expand on this bar chart, a meaningful addition to the narrative of the potential for artifical intelligence to assist a considerable number of tasks in white-collar jobs would be to add information about the particular tasks that were included in each median percentage estimation. I envision that a sample of the included tasks for each category of required education could be added to the right of the bar chart similar to the presentation of a visualization legend. In addition, it would also be valuable for this article to include another bar chart that is more comprehensive; this more comprehensive bar chart could display the estimated percentage share of tasks that can be assisted by artificial intellgience for each occupation. As a reader, it would be intriguing to see the breakdown of the estimated percentages of shared tasks that can be assisted by artificial intelligence for each occupation and how these percentages map to the median percentage share of all tasks shown in the first bar chart.
