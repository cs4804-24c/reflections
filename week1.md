This visualization if from the post on Sunday, February 16, 2020, entitled: "How much harder is onsighting vs redpointing?"</br></br>
The basic idea behind this data visualization is to illustrate how much harder completing a climbing route is when attempting to complete it "onsight" 
(without ever having attempted it before or knowing the right moves to make before hand) and when attempting to complete it after deliberate practice (redpointing).
The data that is used is many different climbers' top climbing grade achieved in both styles of climbing. The more climbers that can redpoint a climb of at most
a certain grade, the wider that section of the graph will be. I generally like the color scheme and the ability to quickly determine where the most common maximum
grade is for each style of climbing is. In relation to the initial question asked, it is then easy to determine that onsighting a route is about 3 climbing grades 
harder than redpointing a route. I don't like that there is no way to determine anything about the absolute number of climbers whose maximum grade for each style 
is within a certain range. Maybe there could have been some sort of horizontal scale to represent this. The way this visulzation is set up currently, only relative information is displayed. The vertical scales also make it somewhat cumbersome to quickly determine which direction is more difficult. I am thinking that for me, flipping this to be horizontal might have been more intuitive, but I am not sure if this would be true for others. Also, while it is a nice visual to see the dot in/around the center of the formations, it would be nice to see on the visualziation itself what these actually represent. I am also thinking that this kind of visualization might not work in situations where the data collected does not have a lot of variation as it could get difficult to discern where any peaks or troughs are.
