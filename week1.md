I really like this style of pie chart. It makes me feel like I'm looking at a map, and they're all islands. This diagram shows purchase orders of planes from airlines. There's actually a decent amount I don't like. The text is scattered around in weird small ways. It also repeats itself too much which sucks when it's already a chore to read. The small pie charts at the bottem are cool, but they could be indicated by the matching airline colour to be easily referenced instead of plane (haha plain) text. While supposed to show massive investments into the futures indicating which airlines are heavily investing in their future, but I feel it lacks any of the important context. Delta for instance is one of the largest airlines in the world and is noticebly absent. Does that mean they aren't investing in their future. It's not just that they're old and established, otherwise we would see the other old and established airlines. Also the hue of blue on the top is bad imho.
