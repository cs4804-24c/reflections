Entitled : How a panel blew off a Boeing plane in mid-air

In the article “How a panel blew off a Boeing plane in mid-air” it discusses the recent Alaska Airlines jet that experienced a fuselage panel tearing off mid flight.
The torn panel left a huge hole  in the plane and it was 16,000 feet in the air. Thankfully the plane landed with 171 passengers with only minor injuries.
As of now there is plenty of on going investigations about how this happened and how it could have been prevented.The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the MAX9 planes and there has been plenty of data created to explore the safety of these aircrafts.
The graph I decided to look at  illustrates the timeline of 737 MAX 9 aircraft operation by various airlines from 2017 to 2024.According to data from FlightRadar24 the majority of flights conducted by Boeing 737 MAX 9s since Dec. 15 were in the United States.This raises concerns as most Americans fly out for the holiday season. Also we expect planes to be safe and throughly inspected but it seems like that is not the case here. This graph peaked my interest because I love to stay up to date on current news. Also as someone who likes to travel this is a concern and a fear a lot of people have when flying on a plane.
