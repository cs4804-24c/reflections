The source I picked is a heatmap showing the layoffs and discharges seasonality coefficients. It was the topic got my attention
at the first place. The title is bold and short, clearly conveys the main idea of this graph and what the reader cares the most 
about.

I think heatmap is a great choice here, compared with bar chart or line chart. As for this specific topic, the month is a discrete
value and readers mostly care about which specific month are most likely to get laid off instead of the trend across the entire year.
The heatmap provides a quick visual summary of such information, allowing for immediate identification of which months and which
industries have higher or lower seanoality coefficients for layoffs and discharges. It also allows for the comparision of multiple
variables at once. In a single glance, one can compare different industries and different months, which would be more complex in a bar
or line chart, especially when dealing with more than two dimensions. Imaging using bar or line chart to present the coefficients,
the color gradients used here can be mroe visually engaging and can convey information more intuitively than the heights of bars or
the positions of line chart points.

If there's any potential improvement, I would probably move the explanation of the coefficient value to the bottom of the graph so
that readers will come to the heatmap directly without the distraction of the words. Even there's no explanation of the coefficient
value, I believe the dark red color in the heatmap still conveys the message clearly that the January has the highes chance of 
being laid off.
