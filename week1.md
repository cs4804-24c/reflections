This is an animated visual I found on r/dataisbeautiful that visualizes global warming. This graph starts off by incrementing over relatively small stretches of time showing how the average temperature anomaly will stay consistent for these small spans of time. The creator cherry picks certain stretches of time where the mean global temperature stays the same or decreases. As you take a step back and view the change in temperature from about 50 years ago to the present, you can see that the mean global temperature has actually been increaseing steadily. This is an example of Simpson's Paradox which is defined as a statistical phenomenon where an association between two variables in a population emerges, disappears or reverses when the population is divided into subpopulations. I found this to be a great animated visual representation of global warming. Even though its just a basic line chart, it does a great job of visualizing the data. I like that you don't see the data all at once but in intervals. This really drives home the nature of Simpsons paradox to me. This was a good reminder to me that data can be misleading if presented in the right manner.
