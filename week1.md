This infographic about world population is well put together, and the first thing that stands out about it is how the data is color coded for easy readability. The visualization does a good job comparing the relative populations of different countries by putting them side by side and scaling the size to match relative populations. The data is also labeled neatly. Additionally the visualization separately compares the populations of major territories within each continent. It also contains a world map that is color coded according to the rest of the elements. This infographic stood out to me because the colors and shapes were eye-catching. The overall graphic is very easy to understand, and doesn't leave out any important information. The way the data is laid out makes it easy to understand because it shows clear size comparisons between the elements that represent population. The only thing that can not be easily learned from this is the hierarchical order of population by country or territory, but doing this would take away from the good qualities of the graph. This graph seems like a friendly way to represent data, as opposed to a more technical way of displaying; in a spreadsheet for example.
Overall, this is a good example of data visualization.
