The visualization that I chose comes from a story on The Pudding regarding how the neighborhood you grow up in affects your economic success and mobility in the future. 
The visualization compares the communities of Gardena and Fremont using circular bars representing percentiles in different categories (where a full semicircle represents 100%)
I think that the method of using semi-circular bars to compare two different areas creates a really clear comparative visual, because it is very easy for the viewer
to tell which of the bars is longer than the other. Additionally, the markings denoting the 0th, 25th, and 50th percentiles add even more clarity, and the viewer is able to
use them as benchmarks for the length of the bars. The colors of each of the bars are clearly differentiated from each other, which makes reading the legend on the sides
a lot easier. This visualization was also interactive, adding each of the bars one at a time as the user scrolls. Adding the opposing bars for each of the communities at 
separate times also increased the impact that the visualization had, because the time that the bar took to reach its full size also correlated with the percentile of the bar.
I think the choice to include both the data about the racial makeup of the city in addition to the median household incomes was an interesting choice. By including them all
in one visualization it gives the reader the opportunity to misintepret something or become confused about how the two topics are related. This is especially evident in how the lengths of 
the bars are very different, with both of the categories showing the racial makeup percentiles being much smaller than the household median incomes'. However, I do think that 
having multiple visualizations to represent the differences in these communities would be more confusing than the singular one. Overall, I think that the visualization is 
visually compelling and attractive, as well as does an effective job of communicating the data that the author intended.
