Overview: Why we can’t trust machine learning - based on the concept of “Four Germans Paper” proposed by Tufts University demonstrating some of the flaws of machine learning. 

The article is paired with an interactive visual to demonstrate the performance of various machine learning algorithms. More specifically, the overall goal of the algorithms is to determine the area of a rectangle that encompasses all the positive cases and disregards the negative ones. One potential real-world application would be in diagnostics or medication prescriptions which makes all the evident flaws crucial to human wellbeing. 
	The article discusses the flaws of using incomplete or biased data sets stating that the outputs will greatly vary - sometimes producing results no better than random guesses. Thus, careful composition of the training and testing datasets is crucial for the model to be applicable in the real world. 
	The author uses the interactive graphic to demonstrate various mathematical concepts associated with optimal fitting of the rectangle. For example, the author uses a small example to demonstrate how probably approximately correct (PAC) learning  is a proven way to result in the most optimal outputs given the dataset. Using an interactive graphic to show how such an approach produces outputs make complicated concepts a lot more digestible thus allowing for a wider range of audience to understand the article without any prior required knowledge. One flaw of such a graphical representation is that it can miss some of the important details of the logical basis of the model.
