Reflection:

Abdulrasaq Ariyo cleaned a dataset from another dataset about the popular streaming service Netflix. 
The dataset was cleaned by treating the nulls, treating duplicates, populating missing rows, dropping uneeded columns, and splitting columns.
After cleaning, the author created a handful of data visualizations with Tableau.
I focussed on looking at the two charts about "Movie & TV Show by Country".
The first chart is a dot distribution map.
I personally disliked this visualization because most of the countries had tiny dots and it was very hard to compare the countries outside of the US and India.
As it currently stands, a small dot with maroon/red color on a black background is very hard to see and compare.
I think it would of been better to use more contrasting colors and bigger dots.
The second chart is an alternative view of the first chart.
It uses a stacked bar chart of the top ten countries and allows a clearer comparison that the dot map lacked.
However, the issue here is that you can only see the top ten countries instead of seeing every country.
As a viewer, the first instinct I had was comparing my own country to the top.
Luckily my country was in the top ten, but what if it wasn't?
I would be left unsatisified if I didn't see my country, in which the dot distrubtion map would have been better.
