The Problem With Plastics - https://informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/the-problem-with-plastics-and-recycling-bioplastics-microplastics-ocean-waste/

A Senki Diagram that goes over global plastic use, the diagram uses bold colors that avoid the common color blindness issue. The text used is easy to read and associate with the data it is related to. The additional comments off to the side are interesting and relevant to the data being described without distracting from the main points. The top down structure of the graphic is easy to follow and relate to our common understanding of resource flow. Total amounts are listed to give context to the percentages used. I'm not sure the font used is entirely the right choice, as the thin and discrete nature of the light grey side text clashes somewhat with the larger, rounded, bubbly feeling font on the bright solid color bars. It might be better to either play more fully into the more professional, sleek, and discreet style or the energetic, large, and colorful style rather than have the split that seems to be present. The side text could be changed to a larger font with color related to the bars they are connected to or the font for the text on the bars could be changed into something less bubble and rounded. One possible addition that might improve the graphic would be a breakdown of where plastic is being used and recycled, as values could differ greatly from continent to continent or country to country. Another possibility would be to illustrate how plastic use has changed over time, possibly through a number of side-by-side Senki Diagrams.
