After our first class, I began to look at data from a new perspective that made me appreciate the little design efforts a person will make
to display their data. Data might sound like numbers and bar graphs but while doing research on the visualization ecosystem I came
across various graphs that show there is more to the subject. I found a graph of the world's 8 billion population and where they are all
located.

From its bright colors to the shapes, this visualization not only made reading the data easy but also made it hard to stop looking at it.
The design utilized the context of the "world" population and displayed the information in a space background with an earth-shaped
layout to give the viewer a space view of the planet. Each country also has its own section in the circle but what makes it interesting
is that each country has a ratio of circles filled in depending on the size of the population. If you went in and looked at the data
blindly without reading the title, due to its appearance, it is very easy to deduct that it is a graph of world population as well.

I am fond of the colors they decided to use as they make the sections pop out respectively and don't make each section blend in with each
other. What was also very interesting was the added mini graphs on the top of the graphic that split up the populations by regions in
each continent giving the user a deeper look into the data.

With new trends in data visualization, it is very clear that appearance will always be the top priority to catch the viewer's eyes.
