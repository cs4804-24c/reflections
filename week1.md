I think that this article, on a meta level, shows how consulting firms such as McKinsey are able to justify its existence almost exclusively through the use of data visualization. 
Using simplistic tools such as Tableau and Alteryx, McKinsey can create visual diagnostics about topics ranging from the economic impact of the war on Ukraine to an increase in workplace attrition.
One could go a step further and say that data visualization is one of the key components of pure business value for engineers; most people can not read, write and understand code, and even fewer are able
to comprehend the significance of advanced system architecture, or how using NoSQL over SQL for a specific project would ultimately reduce costs, but this could easily be converted into visuals readable
by various stakeholders, removing the need for technical knowledge for relevant individuals to understand key concepts. If you can utilize data visualization tools to succinctly prove business points, you can generate
value, and value directly correlates to profit. Every time you see an Excel graph, or a chart generated by R, you are essentially viewing technology in use to generate business value. Anywhere data is relevant within a
business-facing context, data visualization is equally relevant.
