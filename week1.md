This visualization examines each team in the NFL and how they have performed in the playoffs from 2002 to 2021. It uses a circular bar chart with each bar representing their playoff run that year. 

My first takeaway from this piece is that the more colorful a team's circle is, the more successful they have been. Also some fanbases measure success by superbowls, so I like how the creator made the superbowl a distinct color as opposed to a gradient of green. When you hover over one of the bars on the visualization, text comes up that says what the team achieved that year. I think the creator could have made these texts more descriptive with the score of the game and who they lost to. 

A small adjustment I would make to this visual is the space between the circular chart and the row of titles and charts below it. In the middle of the visual it can get confusing which team corresponds to what graph. 

I do not like the circular axis for time. It is misleading as year 2002 is directly next to 2021, so if a team had won a superbowl in both of these years, the audience would immediately think of them winning back to back super bowls. This idea also applies for the surronding years, the distance between the years is lost in this visual. Another aspect I do not like about the vizual is that teams that relocated during this time period appear twice. Using domain knowledge, the creator should have known that it is still the same team and have one graph titled with the two different locations that the team played at with a line with when the team relocated.
