For this week's reflection, I looked at https://philogb.github.io/page/temperature-anomalies/. 
I always have found climate change visualizations interesting and this is one of the more unique ones I have seen. 
I also like this example because you can see how it has evolved from the original one https://philogb.github.io/philogl/PhiloGL/examples/temperatureAnomalies/
The main example does a satisfactory job of depicting the magnitude of change from decade to decade and really makes you think about
the significance of the data and its impact. However, there is always room for improvement, and one possible one is indicating 
what constitutes a temperature anomaly. From a technical standpoint, this visualization uses data from NASA and WebGL. WebGL is a Javascript API
used for graphics that is often a common way to create visualization for data in web browsers. Specifically this visualization was tied to a chapter
in the book WebGL Insights, and the chapter being “Data Visualization Techniques with WebGL”. As someone with not a ton of WebGL experience, I believe that
it would be interesting to learn more about WebGL visualizations.
