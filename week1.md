<h1>Week 1 Reflection</h1>
<p>While scrolling Instagram, I came across a data visualization created by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/mayaamerdesign/?g=5">@mayaamerdesign.</a> In the midst of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, she created a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/CzEtvjKMBg8/?igsh=bDh3aTl5ODMzMmJw">visualization</a> to represent the death count of Palestinians in Gaza during October 2023 in a meaningful way that connected back to Palestinian culture. To measure the impact and success of this visualization, I will use a <a href="https://informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/what-makes-a-good-data-visualization/">framework</a> created by David McCandless to analyze 4 different aspects of it: information, visual form, story and goal. In terms of the information presented by the visualization, the death toll of Palestinians has been verified by numerous trustworthy news networks like <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/how-many-palestinians-have-died-gaza-war-how-will-counting-continue-2023-12-06/">Reuters</a> indicating that the data presented is accurate. For the visual form of the visualization, the creator connected the death toll to an ancient Palestinian embroidery style and created a metaphor. Every Palestinian death is represented by a stitch in the completed embroidery with different stitch colors representing a different age group. This visual choice was a beautiful homage to Palestinian culture and history. I personally appreciated the story the creator used to present the visualization, they animated the visualization to introduce a legend of what all the stitches and how different colors indicate different age groups of people and then broke down the completed visualization based on the different stitches to maximize the impact. I believe the creator achieved their goal with this visualization. Not only did they communicate the hard data and the sheer amount of Palestinian deaths in this conflict but they also entwined the data with a visualization of Palestinian culture.</p>
