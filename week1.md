This graph represents the popularity of movies according to box office sales. Both color and shape of the area curve represent the sale. This lets you see the particularly popular movies since they stick out. However, the less popular movies hide away because the $25-100 million grossing movies are particularly dense. The interactive ability is helpful for this, as you can highlight particular movies and read more about them.  However, many of them are still difficult to click through due to how close they are in numbers (which means they are very close in shape and color). The colors are also appropriate because they limit it to 4 rather than a full gradient, which promotes clarity. Additionally, you can see how the movie “ebbs and flows” while the color stays consistent according to the total domestic gross. You can also see the popularity of movies as a whole throughout time because they are adjusted for inflation. April to August 2007 was particularly profitable for movies as a whole, which can be easily seen by the shape and colors.
