I found this visualization showing Gamestop's top 10 supplier relationships. There were also a ton of other visualizations of other aspects of Gamestop's supply chain, as well as many other companies'.
It shows a hierarchy of Gamestop, its suppliers, and other companies using those suppliers. I find this interesting because it provides a deeper view of the relationships between Gamestop and other companies that aren't always so direct or obvious. 
This visualization is appealing and informative. I like the layout of the hierarchy view, but it also includes an alternate Sankey style visualization of the same data, which adds value.
It is cleanly labeled and color coded, which helps me to understand what role each company plays with respect to Gamestop.
It also has links so that when you click on any company name listed in the hierarchy, you're directed to a page full of visualizations for that company specifically. You could follow a trail this way, going deeper into supply chain relationships than would be possible with a visualization this readable. This adds information without being confusing or cluttered. 
And when you hover over the name of a supplier, it shows you how many sea shipments were made from that company to Gamestop, which again adds more useful information without being too busy. And it explains the vertical order they appear in.
And you can also see how many sea shipments were made from suppliers to the other companies shown in the hierarchy.
Overall it is very nice to look at and seems informative to someone who doesn't know much about the topic (me). I think a lot of its value also comes from the fact that it is but one entry in a page full of other visualizations which together tell a more complete story.
But I think it would be more clear if there was some sort of indication of the range of time these numbers are measured over. I'm not sure if the top supplier has made 278 sea shipments total, or just this year, or whatever else. 
Also, I found out I could click on / hover over the company names on my own, but it would have been nice to have that hint shown somewhere in the visualization, because maybe someone could miss it.
