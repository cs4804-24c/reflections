The data visualization in this article aims to illuminate the death tolls of pandemics over the course of human history, which are often 
underestimated. This visualization was released on December 7, 2023, which I find to be a very impactful time to release this type of
information. At this point in time, the consumers of this article have the experience of the COVID pandemic fresh in thier minds.
Articles and news reports have displayed the effects of this recent pandemic on the world, which gives consumers a frame of reference
when they compare the death toll of the COVID pandemic to that of other pandemics in this visualization. When first viewing this visualization,
I was certainly shocked to see the number of pandemics that had an even higher death toll than the COVID pandemic.

I find this visualization to be both informative and engaging. The layout of the visualization with multiple colors and shapes spanning across
the page makes it must easier for the reader to digest all of the words on the page. I like the author's idea of making the size of each 
circle proportional to the death toll, which can be very difficult considering how vastly different each pandemic can be. One suggestion that I 
have for this is for the author to potentially make the circles for pandemics with a smaller death toll (ex. 2003 SARS epidemic with 774 recorded
deaths) slightly larger because currently, they are virtually invisible and it can be a bit confusing to know where the words are pointing to. While 
this may mean that the size of the circle is not exactly proportional to the death toll, I do not think this would be misleading to the
reader, as the death toll number is directly below it. I think the triangles were a very clever way to include pandemics that had a significant, yet 
unknown impact of the communities they encountered. The triangles allow the reader to learn about these pandemics without being confused or 
mislead by circles with inaccurate sizes. I also think making the color of each circle/ triangle and the corresponding text represent the pathogens 
that caused the pandemic is very helpful in visualizing how one disease can be so harmful time and time again. The author discusses in the article 
that having this knowledge of which pathogens caused each pandemic allows scientists to respond to pandemics more quickly and effectively, 
as they have a better understanding of how the pathogen spreads and how to prevent it. Another element of this visualization that makes it
easy to understand is that the timeline stays consistent, with one horizontal line and one curve representing 50 years. This helps the consumer
see that the number of pandemics between 1800 and 2000 have been pretty evenly spread. I think the decision to include the major pandemics
prior to the 19th century off the timeline instead of trying to extend the timeline back more was a wise choice by the author.

Key takeaways: The effectiveness of timelines in visualizing data over time, the power of shape, size, and color in conveying information,
the importance of keeping visualizations consistent, spreading visualizations with a lot of information across a page can make it less 
cluttered and easier to digest.
