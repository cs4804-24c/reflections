The graph I chose is a dumbbell plot of the ages of previous presidential candidates. I appreciated the use of the dumbbell plot. It works really well to depict the age difference between candidates during each individual election as well as the differences in ages of candidates throughout different elections. I also liked the use of the yellow circle. It makes it very clear which of the candidates won each year. Another part of the graph that I found interesting was that even though the data is fairly scattered throughout the graph, I can still see an upward trend even with the age gaps displayed. However, something I did not like was the inclusion of the names of the candidates on the graph itself. I feel that the names create too much clutter directly on the graph. I think it would have been better to have the names separate from the graph or not included at all as I do not believe the names are crucial to the understanding of the graph. Nevertheless, I do not think that this detracts too much from the presentation of the data.
