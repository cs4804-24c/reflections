I chose to do a reflection on a data visualization I found on a page called selfiecity. The page basically has to do with studying the “science of selfies”.

Selfiecity's method of organizing image grids based on head tilt and employing variations like normal, cropped, and cropped-and-rotated images effectively serves its goal of exploring selfie demographics, poses, and expressions. This approach allows for a structured analysis of pose variations across individuals and cities, aiding in the identification of patterns. 

The innovation lies in the use of normal, cropped, and cropped-and-rotated images, which focuses on facial features and enhances the visual appeal of the findings. However, there is potential bias introduced by the cropping and rotation choices, since image editing for better ability to categorize is subjective.</p>
<p>While emphasizing facial features aligns with project goals, there's a risk of neglecting contextual information, like by cropping and rotating an image, you may discard background elements crucial for understanding cultural or environmental context.

The method excels in facilitating visual comparisons, yet acknowledging differences in cultures when deciding what is and isn’t important to consider in these images is crucial. Providing smaller, visual aids with annotations or captions explaining the significance of size or placement of images might enhance clarity for a diverse audience and thereby make this project and its findings more accessible and understandable for a wider range of folks. 

In summary, Selfiecity's approach is effective in achieving its objectives, especially in organizing and presenting visual data, in that the type of data being represented has rarely been presented in such a raw manner. Innovations in scaling image similarities or presence/absence of certain qualities in images to create a graph-like representation of the image data contributes to interpretability and engagement. Addressing potential bias, considering contextual elements, and enhancing clarity in communication will strengthen the approach, ensuring a comprehensive exploration of selfie behavior.
