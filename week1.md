This chart visualizes Mt Everest Expeditions with the Himalayan Database. It plots how long it took to climb vs the elevation. I like how it highlights certain expeditions, as well as some trends such as a minor positive correlation. It would be interesting to see if there were certain people that climbed for a long time but didn't make it far up the mountain; I guess the absence of such would indicate people that plan to climb are either fit or motivated to complete their climb. Though, I feel like this chart deviates from the traditional visualization that you would expect for something like climbing. I personally would think there would be a time metric, such as year of ascension. This could highlight some addl info such as how tech might have evolved over the years to allow faster climbs, or newer methods. Another one might be something like # of successful climbs per year, or by age, but you can only highlight so much with a simple plot. Some improvements could be indicating more info on what the starting point is. Does the expedition start at 5360m, or somewhere before? It would give the lay audience more context and understanding of the people that climbed.
