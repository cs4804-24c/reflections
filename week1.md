Graph database visualizations are an emerging form of visualization that is linked to the graph data model, which is an alternative to the relational data model that is the current most widely used database system. 
Relational data models use rows and columns to represent relationships between records, allowing multiple data fields to be provided for a single record. Usually SQL or a similar languague will be used to query a relational 
data model and retrieve specific records. This is useful for data tables in which data points are plotted based on their connection to a single entity, such as a date, location, person, or company. However, in order to 
capture complex relationships between these entities instead of the data points associated with them, graph data models provide visualizations of large networks. The visualization of the internet's growth linked below is a 
good example of this because it shows the interconnected nature of the web in a way that can't be shown by a regular chart. By revealing clusters of nodes and ranges of interconnectedness between them, graph data 
visualization gives insights into activity and significance of entities within a larger structure. Graph visualization styles can be used to illustrate anything from social media connections to computer networks.
Additionally, clustering algorithms can be used to make movie recommendations and detect fraud rings. Both graph algorithms and graph data model visualizations can reveal crucial insights into the data of intricate networks and their connections.
