One of the most important factors in space weather (geomagnetic storms, radio blackouts, solar radiation storms) is the solar cycle.
Discovered in the 19th century, the solar cycle is a roughly 11 year cycle of solar activity that the sun follows between times of low activity (and therefore low risk of space weather events) and times of high activity.
Currently, the strongest indicator known of the solar cycle position is the sunspot number, which has been tracked for over 400 years and therefore has more data available than any other current method.
Since the sunspot number directly reflects the frequency of solar flares and other space weather events, being able to predict the sunspot number into the future is valuable in knowing when space weather will be in active periods and vice versa.
In 2019, a new solar cycle was beginning, and the Space Weather Prediction Center (subset of NOAA) released a prediction for the sunspot number and solar flux during the solar cycle beginning in 2019 and ending in 2032. 
However, since late 2021, actual sunspot numbers have consistently exceeded the range of uncertainty given for the 2019 prediction, so the SWPC has decided to issue a new improved forecast for the remainder of this solar cycle.

I think the biggest personal takeaway from this visualization is how effective it is able to represent uncertainty in the predictions.
Oftentimes, concepts like uncertainty can be difficult to visualize, but here the gradient-shaded area combined with the quartile key makes it easy to see how accurate the SWPC expects their prediction to be over the forecast period.
Another good addition is the inclusion of the actual measured sunspot numbers, as this allows the audience/customer to see both how the sunspot number trends over time as well as infer how the sunspot number might actually vary in the future beyond the model forecast and corresponding uncertainty regions.
Beyond this, there is evident attention to detail as well, even though the visualization is essentially a glorified line chart. 
A good example of this detail is how the colors are added together where the new and old model predictions overlap.
This addition makes it much easier to actually see this part of the graph as an overlap instead of the colors turning into a confusing mess.

Overall, this visualization is simple and effective, but of course there is a huge amount of potential left on the table here.
Some ideas I immediately think of on expanding on this forecast could include an interactive tooltip on the mouse cursor, where users/customers could hover over parts of the graph and see exact values.
Another good addition could be designing in several different color palettes to make the visualization better from an accessability standpoint.
Since this plot is still in the experimental stages, it is likely that we will see a much more advanced and polished visualization in the future.
