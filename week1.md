This graph/data shows the percentage and the amount of international students from different countries that got accepted into
a US Institution. I believe this data is interesting because it shows the diversity of the US and how many students are
from each country. The data is presented in a unique way that somewhat represents a pie chart. The graph labels the 
different regions of the world,  which includes 3 regions of Asia, Northern America, Europe, Oceania, Africa, etc., 
each having their own section and colors. Within each section, they also split it up further into different countries. Then
they show the percentages and the amount of students within each country.

The graph does a great job at capturing the attention of the audience. The colors are bright and vibrant, and the graph is 
unique in terms of its shape and design. The size of each section also corresponds to the percentages and the amount
of students, which helps the audience easily view and understand the data. While the colors of each section are great, 
I think the graph can do a better job at labeling each section, and assigning a color to the text as well. For example,
while the section and text for Asia is purple, the text for number of students and the different regions of Asia are 
black. I believe a better color scheme would be to have different shades of purple for the different regions of Asia 
and have that correspond to the section as well. For example, Southeast Asia would have a different purple than South and 
Central Asia, and East Asia. In addition, better consistency with the colors and text would also enhance the visualizations
of the graph.
