# Week 1 Reflection
### Nicholas Markou

For this reflection, I chose a visualization from /r/dataisbeautiful on Reddit titled 
[_Small Enough to Fail: Bank Failures in the U.S. (2000-2023)_](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/18pjh3o/small_enough_to_fail_bank_failures_in_the_us/) created by c_h_a_r_.
This visualization has a base layer map of the United States, with spots on the map where banks have failed in the past 23 years. This visualization has a 3D effect with it as well
as if one location had multiple failures, the bar on the location appears to be taller than those that had less. This is easily noticeable in Chicago and Atlanta. 

I chose to reflect on this visualization because I think there may have been better ways to design this visualization to contain more information and be more detailed. Firstly, I like that
the creator decided to use a map of the entire United States as this can show us the exact location within a state where a bank failed. This shows the reader more information as there are multiple cities in a state where 
a bank can fail (ex. California). The darker color and increase in height on each marker for multiple failures also stand out, such as in the city of Atlanta. While this is effective, I think it could be improved
to showcase more information and also be more readable. Instead of using a 3D effect, it might be better to return to a 2D map and use circles, increasing the diameter of the circle when there are more failures. 
This may be ineffective with nearby cities that also experienced bank failures. Additionally, this circle could be turned into a pie chart, representing the percentage of failures in each year (or every few years).
This could help identify how many bank failures occurred during the recession in 2008. 

This visualization could be further improved by making it interactive. Possible interactability could be showing the city name and the number of bank failures when a marker is clicked on. Additionally, 
the ability to zoom in could be helpful to see states with multiple cities that experienced bank failures in close proximity, such as in the northern part of Georgia. It could also be interesting to add a 
date range slider to the visualization, allowing it to show the bank failures that only occurred during the Great Recession in 2008, or those that happened during the 2010s. 

In conclusion, while this visualization is effective at showing bank failures in the United States, it can easily be improved and expanded upon. I think with a map of this size (the entire United States), interactivity can
improved the understandability so users can narrow down the map and not get overwhelmed with all the content on the map.
