The graphs in this article shows each candidate's path to the GOP nomination for 2024. Based on which states they’re 
strongest in, they calculate how many delegates each candidate needs to win to be on pace to win the nomination. 
Each candidate must receive the majority of their party’s delegates to win the nomination. For Republicans, 
there are nearly 2,500 delegates, and a candidate needs 1,215 delegates to win the nomination. For Democrats, 
there are around 3,900 delegates, and 1,969 are needed to win. The candidates are compared using a line graph 
showing how many delegates need to nominate the candidate in each month. The interactive ability to display 
information when hovering over a particular point in a candidate's graph is helpful to the user when trying to 
figure out how many more delegates the candidate needs to be nominated. On the right hand side of the graph, 
states become highlighted to signify which states have voted for the candidate. This seems very useful as it 
shows the estimated timeline of events that could happen during each candidate's path to nomination. Also when 
you hover over a particular spot on the graph, it will then highlight what states they have to win over to be on 
path for nomination. The keys for being over and under the benchmark are not used in any of the graphs, 
this could potentially be confusing as it makes the graphs less clear whether a candidate is estimated to be 
over or under the benchmark for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination. The keys might not be appearing because 
the graphs show what the voting distribution looked like in the past and the voting for GOP nomination 
in 2024 will start Monday, January 15. Since the GOP nominations for 2024 have yet to start, 
the graphs are not fully complete but the article does a great job in providing useful information 
to the viewer and allowing them to follow each candidate's journey daily during their run.
