The poll  on the Iowa Repuhblican Primary form FiveThirtyEight is incredibly interesting. The fact that every single candidate has a different color makes it very easy to tell which candidate you are looking at. Additionally, the fact that the uncertainties are also color coded allows you to tell the best and worst case for every politician. The key also makes it very easy to analyze the graph, even at a first glance I can tell that on December 30th Donald Trump has 50% of the projected vote on average. In addition, at the bottom you can see the average of every politician at the time your mouse is at. You can also see that these graphs show 95% of all polls shown. 

However, I do have some criticisms. The polls rely on an average, it is vunerable to outliers, while Ramaswamy is currently sitting at 6.6% of the polls an outlier saying he has a 90% of predicted votes, it would be taken into account. Instead I would be using an approach that would be inspired by a box and whisker chart with a gradient from the average, allowing the graphs to show the full average. Additionally, similarly to what I've done at my Coop at TTM technologies, I would also allow the user to select and deselect which politician they are looking at. If thats done a user can take one politician out of the race to have a cleaner view.
