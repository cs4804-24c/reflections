Link to TheUpshot article, "Can’t Think, Can’t Remember: More Americans Say They’re in a Cognitive Fog", with a visualization that I read: https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/13/upshot/long-covid-disability.html

Visualization Reflection:

In TheUpshot article, "Can’t Think, Can’t Remember: More Americans Say They’re in a Cognitive Fog", author Francesca Paris goes into detail about the potential causes and numbers behind the increased cognitive issues of working-age adults since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. While there are multiple data visualizations shown in the article, the first multiline chart that appears titled "Percent of working-age people who said they had “serious difficulty” with …" caught me attention. This visualization shows multiple lines spanning the years 2008-2023, and each line represents a particular task that involves some level of cognition and possibly physical movement. The only aspect of this multiline chart that I disagree with immediately is the abscence of x-axis and y-axis labels. Although it can be quickly deduced that the x-axis displays years and the y-axis displays percentages of people, the labels for these data types should still be present. The three critical tasks that are assigned their own line are "Walking or taking the stairs", "Remembering, concentrating, or making decisions", and "Doing basic errands outside the home", and I agree with the design choice to label each of these lines within the chart instead of employing a legend; having the line labels reside within the chart helps keep the viewer's attention on the represented data. In addition, I also agree with the interesting design choice of displaying a small arrow within the chart labelled "START OF PANDEMIC" to denote the approximate time that the COVID-19 pandemic began. The inclusion of this arrow on a conceptual level also compliments the "Remembering, concentrating, or making decisions" line emphased with a red color fill. Since one of the main ideas of the article is that there are more Americans who are having difficulty remembering, concentrating, or making decisions in recent years, the inclusion of the "START OF PANDEMIC" arrow in the chart helps bring attention to the "Remembering, concentrating, or making decisions" line that demonstrates this recent increase in American cognitive difficulties. Since the represented data accounts for Americans ages 18-64, one idea for a future extension of this visualization is to show the percentage of Americans who had serious difficulty with these tasks for smaller age ranges within the 18-64 age bracket.
