<h1>Week 2 Reflection</h1>
<p>Recently, I have been enjoying data visualizations created by award-winning information designer <a href="https://www.behance.net/FedericaFragapane">Frederica Fragapane.</a> I especially enjoyed her data visualizations on land use, mobility and inequality in the EU. In this <a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/171008143/Land-use-mobility-and-inequality-in-the-EU">report</a>, she created a visualization on land cover overview for the EU in 2018. The chart shows a section for every country in the EU, with the country's section being relative to their land mass and size. Their section is split into categories based on how much artificial land, cropland, grassland, shrubland, woodland or other land the country has. The categories are differentiated with various textures or colors according to the category. Fragapane is known for creating visualizations that are not only legible but also beautiful. The color and texture schemes that she uses throughout her visualizations are pleasing to the eye, and convey the data they're representing (for ex; the grass category is represented by a blue/green grass-like texture). Fragapane proves that data visualizations don't have to be brutalist in their visual design, but can also be aesthetically pleasing without sacrificing function.</p>
