I like this data visualization because it shows the movement over time which helps visualize the real transitions between daily activities. It also lets you see popular daily activities as a whole. I appreciate the narration throughout the day (like people are usually waking up right now) to tell you what you are seeing at that moment. The only critique I would have is that a scrubber would be appreciated to look at the data at your own pace. However the slow/medium/fast speed settings help. I also like the graphs that come out of this visualization that shows a snapshot of movement as lines. 
From this visualization I learned about the term markov chains (the transition matrices used for the visualization). It is interesting because I feel the basics to this transition is very doable at my level and the work pays off. Additionally, the author creates different versions of this dataset using different models which is also a good source to see different angles of the same data.
