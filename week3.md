This visualization sets out to show the distribution of Earth's surface by country/area in the form of a ring chart. I think it is successful in doing so, the size of the area dedicated to each of the countries is relatively easy to compare, especially with the help of the percentages listed next to each country. The text accompanying the image is an appropriate color and font. I like how they use satellite images of the Earth's surface to fill the regions of the chart. I feel that adds a lot to the aesthetic of the graphic. The addition of the ice marker for the oceans is a nice inclusion as well. The larger arcs and their percentages makes it easy to compare each of the larger three sections, though there does appear to be a disconnect between the representation of Territorial Waters/International Waters and their related arcs. The dark green text for the countries areas as percentages of the Earth surface can be difficult to read, not helped by the size of the fonts used. Making the text slightly larger and bright could improve readability. The lines connecting text to visualization regions could also be made thicker. The labels for the smaller countries are difficult to parse, though I can't think of an easy immediate fix. Perhaps use lines to connect them with their regions, then shift the label away so the label has more room? Label the outside of the ring and have the arcs on the inside? Other than that, the only immediate thing I think might also be interesting to see would be to see the distribution of water across the different oceans, seas, lakes, and so on.
