What Americans drink has changed drastically overtime. With more than 500 options to choose from there has been a significant shift in Americans' beverage consumption patterns. There has been a 56% rise in bottled water consumption. This shift has been accompanied by a decline in the consumption of soft drinks, with a 60% decrease among teenagers over the last 15 years. Water both bottled and unbottled is the most consumed drink followed by Coffee (14%), soft drinks (10%), milk (7%), and tea (7%). Milk used to be really popular among children 12 years and younger but this is declining leading to a rise in imitation milk, including plant-based alternatives like soy, rice, and oat milk. Soft drinks, which were the top beverage for teenagers in the mid-2000s, experienced a notable decline, dropping by about 60% in the last 15 years. Lastly, coffee and alcohol consumption for adults remained relatively steady. On average, adults consumed about 1.3 cups of coffee a day, and alcohol consumption showed little change. However, there was a shift in the type of alcohol consumed, with beer and liquor declining and wine and cocktails experiencing increases. 	All of these changes makes sense due the increase popularity in reusable cups such as Stanleys and Owalas. Amongst young people its trendy to have these water bottles in different colors and bring them with you everywhere as part of your everyday style. This has led to the average bottled water consumption doubled, and overall, bottled water consumption rose 56% between 2005-2006 and 2017-2020. Also, there has been a rise in mock-tails and not consuming as much alcohol in millennial which is causing the shift in the type of alcohol consumed from  beer and liquor declining to wine and cocktails on the rise.
