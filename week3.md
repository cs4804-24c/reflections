For this reflection, I chose a visualization titled [*What Counties in the U.S. Are the Most Educated?*](https://overflowdata.com/demographic-data/national-data/county-level-analysis/county-educ-22/) by Chase Sawyer. 
This visualization has an interactable map of the United States, filled in with data on a per-county basis. Firstly, there are multiple sets of data to interact with: High school education, Bachelor's degree, 
or Graduate degree. It's also possible to select multiple in this visualization, but it's hidden in a small dropdown where the education level is selected. I like the ability to select states, or multiple states, for easy
analysis in certain regions. I think the colors/scaling of the colors should be improved in this visualization, especially when there is a smaller amount of data. In the Massachusetts map below, Berkshire County and Middlesex 
County have the same color but have a difference in percentage by over 20%. The coloring of the visualization should be modified depending on the currently selected data, and not be constant. This is equally noticeable in
the same region with Graduate degrees. I also think it would be interesting to see this comparison at a state level, as education is handled at a state level and not at a county level.

Additionally, this visualization struggles to run on my computer when I have all 50 states included. It takes approximately 1-2 seconds to get a response when switching education selected. It also takes about half a second 
for the tooltip to appear over a county. I believe this data may be too large and complicated for Tableau to handle in real time, causing this significant delay in user interaction. 

Overall, I think this is a good start for a successful visualization, but needs a lot of work before I would deem it to be a good complete visualization. The poor color range for the percentage educated severely limits the
ability of the user to compare counties, as well as it taking a long time to load due to the poor performance of Tableau.,
