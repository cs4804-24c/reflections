I found this visualization on flowingdata about the shifting incomes for American jobs from the 1960s to 2014. The jobs ranged from legal and finance, to food preparation and healthcare suppoort. The visualization is a moving bubbles chart and it clearly shows clustering and compares distributions. I enjoyed the animations and how you can see how with time certain jobs have an increase of salary. While there's other jobs that remain with low paying salaries, and some with increasing disparities. There are jobs that pay extremely well, yet there are people at the other end of the chart being paid significantly less. It's confusing to see someone being paid less than $25k a year and working in legal. For this reason, I would like to know what jobs were categorized as each group, since the author notes the occupation groups are broad. There are also some bubbles that appear to be below $0k - I'm not sure if that was meant to be at 0 but as a result of clustering it appears below that. The data was analyzed through R and the visualization was made using d3.js.
