The visualization I looked at this week was a heat map of counties in the United States representing the amount of people burdened by housing cost. I enjoy all the options that were available to filter and change the data that was presented. Seeing the whole picture to get a general idea of the whole United States and including the option to choose specific states to get more detail was a convenient feature. I also like that I can compare the type of owner/renter by swapping between the maps. It gives better perspective rather than just grouping them together. I liked how different parts of the visualization were tied together, such as the top counties being highlighted on the map when the mouse hovered over them on the right side. Furthermore, I enjoyed the ability to click on districts to get more detailed information. However, I didn't like that the only numbers were in percentages. I would have liked to have a real number of households that were burdened as well as total households in each county. I feel that this is vital data to fully understand the information because I am sure there is a drastic difference in the number of households between some districts.
