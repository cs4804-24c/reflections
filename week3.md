I love strange corrolations in data, and these two data sets seem to have nothing to do with eachother. I wouldn't guess that they have anything to do with eachother even given their strong corrolation, but here we are second guessing that notion. It's really hard to completely disregard the corrolation even when nothing else makes sense, which is why I'm proud to announce my new MQP project: finding the reason for corrolation /s. But it's things like this that draw questions, and can only be answered by looking into more data (which is outside the scope of this reflection). Clearly the data is just following the same broad strokes as anything that gets popular, so anything popular peaking around 2018 should also have a high level of corrolation, but even then it begs more questions: What was happening in New Jersey and why did so many statistitions move in and out as a wave.
