Hollywood Hits & Flops 2023 so far:

Reflection:

David McCandless created a visualization using VizSweet on the movies from 2023.
The X axis is the IMDB rating of the movie while the Y axis is the percetange of budget recovered.
The size of the points, or triangles in this case, is the worldwide gross for the movie.
From a quick glance, I saw some obvious hits and flops.
"80 for Brady" was an obvious flop that was expected and "Oppenheimer" was an obvious hit.
What was unexpected was that I expected "Across the Spider-Verse" to have a higher budget recoverd than it was.
It was also interesting to see "Sound of Freedom" having such a high percentage of budget recovered.
Overall I think this visualization did a great job in displaying the data.
It was very easy and quick to understand and used very distinguishable color gradient.
My only issue is that there was a single point, the movie "About My Father" in the bottom left of the graph where there seems to be another movie behind it.
In this case since the two movies did about the same, it was impossible for me to see what the movie behind it was unless I look at the raw data.
