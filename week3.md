There are many issues with this visualization. There are 8 colors used to distinguish between different information, two of them are an entire separate category. This will cause major accessibility issues for color blind people. Having numerous colors in the legend can create visual clutter, making it challenging for users to quickly and accurately interpret the information. When there are too many colors, it becomes harder to distinguish between them, leading to a messy and confusing presentation. A cluttered legend increases cognitive load on the viewer. Cognitive load refers to the mental effort required to process information. If a legend has too many colors, users must expend more mental energy to understand and remember the associations between colors and categories. For some reason in this graph Alaska is dispositionally huge, which can cause some confusion.
