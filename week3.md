Moore's Law Visualized

https://ourworldindata.org/moores-law

This website contains a number of visualizations related to the concept in semiconductor manufacturing known as "Moore's Law."
In 1965, Gordon E. Moore (co-founder of Intel) noticed that the transistor density (number of transistors in a given area) of computer chips had been doubling roughly every 10 years for the past 10 years.
The first graphic on the site shows Moore's original visualization that led him to make the prediction that would eventually be known as Moore's Law.
Notice how this original graph only had five data points and used a somewhat questionable log scale. Based on just this data, Moore made a prediction that has remained true for at least the past 50 years.
The second graph on the page is essentially the same as Moore's original graph, but much more detailed and including many different computer chips from 1970 to nearly the present day.
Here, I find the obvious stagnation between 2007-2012 to be quite interesting. This starts to highlight how Moore's Law is less of a law and has shifted to be more of a guidance for semiconductor manufacturers to follow when deciding how powerful to make a certain generation of hardware.
The next graph highlights how the fastest supercomputers in the world have grown since 1993 using a similar scale to the Moore's Law graph. 
I find it interesting here how the growth of supercomputers has somewhat stagnated in recent years comparatively to more reasonable hardware. Perhaps this hints that even regular computers may start to reach a limit in the near future?
Additionally, I wanted to comment that I find the "time-lapse" feature on this graph to be a bit confusing and a little useless. I like the idea of being able to limit the range of years here but I feel like having it as a time lapse doesn't really add anything to the data.
The final visualization is one showing computer storage and memory costs over time. This one is interesting, but I don't really think the log scale is applicable here.
As an example, take the cost of disk storage between 2011 and now. Although the graph shows a relatively level graph, the overall price of disk storage has actually been cut in half in this time. This is why in my opinion, one must be very careful using log scales for any type of graph that could have a non-scientific audience. Even for technical audiences, log scales can be somewhat misleading and it is important to consider if the benefits of using one will outweigh the tradeoffs.
