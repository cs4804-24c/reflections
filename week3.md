The data visualization I chose to talk about for this reflection is a very simple one, showing the impact of the Pandemic on stock markets (since the beginning of the outbreak). The visualization is very clean, readable, and easy to interpret for anyone, as it has markers/indicators of which line corresponds to which stock market and when the pandemic started as well as when the first vaccine was announced.

As you go down the page, there’s another visualization that shows how the unemployment rates changed in countries around the globe as the pandemic progressed, indicating very clearly how certain countries were much more severely affected than others by the effects of the pandemic.

One of the best visualizations on the page was a map of the world with countries being color-coded based on how far into recession they were, and I felt it gave a very easy to understand picture of how hard the pandemic hit the whole world. Every single one of the visualizations on this page were easy to understand for anyone, regardless of their data literacy level, which is an indication of how well Bloomberg understands their consumers. I think that although most of these styles of data visualization are used almost excessively, when they are done well, then everyone benefits, so I just thought that I’d share this page.
