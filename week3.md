This Data Visualization shows the current head coaches win percent vs. years being with their team. One thing that I find visually appealing 
about this graph is the gradient of percentages from lowest (being red) to highest (being blue).  The gradient is also based off of the 
color scheme where blue is equal to at least one championship in career, yellow equal to 1+ career playoff wins, but no championships, 
and red being no career playoff wins. The visual also has a bunch of interactive hovering visuals, like hovering over axis titles. 
Hovering over the trend lines will give the formulas for each trend line, and hovering over a coach will give their individual 
statistics (career record, team they coached for, career wins, etc.). Another thing I like about this graph is that it has a picture 
of each coach's face on the scatterplot. This makes the graph much more appealing to interact with and it seems to do a better job 
than having any other symbol that would represent the coaches. One thing I wish this graph could have included is what year each 
coach began coaching their team. A feature I would add that I think would be meaningful to this graph is being able to click each 
coach and see the stats for the previous coach of the team and being able to compare them. Overall, I believe this graph is able 
to do its job extremely effectively as it is simple to understand, visually appealing, and provides interesting statistics for all the coaches.
