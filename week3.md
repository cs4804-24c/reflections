I found this visualization on Stack Overflow by using the ggplot2 tag. It immediately stood out to me because it focused on the style of the graph itself rather than the content shown.
All throughout that thread, there are people sharing similarly styled graphs that have nothing else in common besides their XKCD art style. I've seen a few of these comics around the internet, but I definitely have never thought about using a tool to recreate that art style for other purposes.
I thought this was neat to see in the community because the focus was placed on the way the data is presented to the viewer, rather than the data itself or even its organization. Especially considering that this is a hand-drawn and casual style, which goes against how visualizations are usually themed, at least in my experience.
I think this style is really good for emphasizing the storytelling aspect of data visualization. It's basically a comic, after all. But implementing a graph-like look and feel, and actually having a package for ggplot2 to help people implement it themselves, is really cool.
I know I found a few of these entertaining, and these were just some examples to show off the graphics. I enjoyed this "Walking Back to My Front Door at Night" graph in particular because of its creative use of the x and y axes. There are no units of measurement, it's all just kind of vibe-based. Each curve tells its own story, kept in pace with the others by the x axis, which kind of represents space and kind of represents time.
