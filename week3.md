 The above article goes into depth on why data visualization is crucial to machine learning. AI/ML is all the hype right now, but data visualization is decidedly a
 bit overshadowed. Nonetheless, data visualization is arguably just as important when you realize that it is literally just elucidating data in a manner comprehensible
 to non-technical individuals. For example, the article posits that Google Maps is mainly data visualization as it is just visualizing the result of different machine
 learning algorithms. It is also important to understand, when combining data visualization with machine learning, that machine learning is an intersection of advanced
 statistics and complex matrix calculus. It is key to pick visualization methods that are complex enough to handle the intricacies of machine learning, but are 
 simultaneously simplistic enough to be understandable to the untrained eye.
