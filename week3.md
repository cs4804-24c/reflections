Reflection: 
This week I found a website that explores the style of selfies in five cities across the world. The data is split up by 
demographic categories and selfie style. I really like how the visualization starts with all the data pictured below the
categories and then filters the pictures as you add different constraints to the graphs. I also think being able to 
visually select which sections of the data you want to see using the graphs is really helpful for users to understand 
what section of the data set they are viewing. I think the popover of information that appears when hovering over any 
section of the tables is also very helpful for the user providing additional clarity to what they are seeing on the 
graph. I also really like how when you select a section to filter the images, it highlights that section on the graph as
well as filtering the images. I also like how all the rest of the graphs become highlighted in sections where the
information selected overlaps so that you can further filter to find the exact demographic and selfie style you are 
looking for. I also really like the simple count it gives you above the images to tell you how many selfies are being 
pictured, so you can get an accurate number after filtering. One problem I had with the visualization was with the 
accuracy. When you filter throughout the categories, the images that they give you often to not line up with what you 
selected. For example, when you try to select pictures with glasses, there are many selfies that appear that are from 
people not wearing glasses at all. In addition to the full selfie exploration visualization, I think the website had
many other very interesting visualizations throughout including ones that explore smile score, head tilt, gender and age 
distribution, and more.
