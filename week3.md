The following graph is a streamgraph of immigration to the US. It describes the immigration throughout 
the years from 1829 to 2013 and displays which countries have the highest amount of there population entering the United States.

The Streamgraph is very fascinating to look at especially with the use of various colors that grab the viewers attention
immediatly as it's somewhat beautiful to look at. The graph also displays a list, in the same order of the streamgraph, of the
countries/continents that are graphed out. The coloring is something that helps the view out as it allows for the lines
of data to be seperated out clearly while also making it simple for the viewer to differentiate where each countries data points
start and end.

Similar to other graphs we've looked at, the direction of the data is horizontal but as my eye for data visualization grows
it might have been a good idea for the graph to be made vertically. This would create a visualization of a downward stream 
that branches off or like a waterfall that splashes around once it reach the bottom due to the increased immigration as the years
went by.

Data wise, I like that the creator decided to group some countries together within their continent or global region. Listed
in the graph are countries like mexico, India and Italy but their are also regions and continents like South America, Oceania,
and Africa. To a viewer this says a lot about both groups like the fact that mexico has very similar numbers of their population
immigrating to the US as the whole continent of Africa.
