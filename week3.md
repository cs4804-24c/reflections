I chose a piece from the visual capitalist for this week's reflection. This article and visualization focus on visualization of the top 10 largest nuclear explosions. Nuclear explosions are a topic that I feel as though everyone has heard about, but can be quite difficult to wrap your head around, as obviously not many people have seen them firsthand. This visualization gives a height, in meters, for each explosion, as well as includes a scaled graphic of Mount Everest to help readers grasp the magnitude of these explosions.

I think this visualization helps readers put the concepts of nuclear explosions into a more comprehensible scope. The graphic even extends to the height of the stratosphere, to accommodate the largest nuclear explosion ever. I am unsure of what size I thought these explosions were before this graphic, but I can now see how insanely huge they can be.
