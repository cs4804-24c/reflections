This week I came across this website which had visualizations for switching between phone brands.
I really like the structure and simplicity of a chord diagram. I think this visualization is appealing and easy to understand for many users
It also made it easier to comperehend what was going on when it comes to trends in phone brands.
Other than that, I wouldnt say there is much I would change but it would be cool to have this same graph for other countries and see over the last decade
what was trending
