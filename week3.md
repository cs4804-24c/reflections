Given that in Assignment #2 we made use of both d3.js and chart.js, it's probably useful to compare them. Something that the article correctly points out is that d3 
has built-in parsing features that make it more useful when utilizing it for data engineering raw csv files. Conversely, chart has decidedly better performance when
considering large amounts of data. The article concludes that when creating non-chart visualizations, d3 is the correct choice, but for chart-based visualizations, 
chart.js is a better choice due to its various features.
