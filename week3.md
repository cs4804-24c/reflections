The visualization that I looked at this week showed the data surrounding back-to-back plays of country songs on the radio. Specifically, they were looking at 
the gender, sexuality, and racial makeup of the artists whose songs were played. The visualization is composed of multiple columns representing different days
throughout the calendar year, and each column is composed of horizontal bars whose color represents what song by certain artists were played back to back. One of 
the reasons that I like this visualization is the high level of options for customizability that the user has. They can choose from multiple regional locations/radio
stations to see the data for that station, as well as within each station, choose to see the data on back-to-back plays based on gender, race, or sexuality. While
there is a lot of data being shown, the simplicity of the colored thin bars makes it very easy for the user to see at a glance the makeup of the station's back-to-back
plays. I think that the charts of numbers being shown above the visualization makes it a little more confusing, as the numbers aren't always related to the configuration
of the visualization that is being shown. I also do not really like that it is unclear what the columns represents (which are days at 1-2 week intervals throughout the
year). I think that if they were to get rid of the number table and solely show the visualization with a bit more of a descriptive blurb, it would be more effective.
Otherwise, I think the overall design with the columns and thin bars was an excellent choice to showcase the data in this project.
