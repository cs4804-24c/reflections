This is arguable the strangest pie chart I have ever seen. It goes over the top 20 wild fires over time in a pie chart. While it is difficult to read, after you learn to read it, it isn't that complicated, the size of the slices of the pie chart represent the size of forest fires over time. However, it also needs additional text on the chart to indicate when a wild fire occured. The main problem I see with this chart is that wild fire size isn't really something that has a "total" that can be subdivided unless you do it oddly. I personally think a more traditional scatterplot with a line of best fit where the biggest fires are pointed out as individual data points would be better. As the article I found this chart in says "I don't think it works all that well..." in regards to the graph. Its confusing, it doesn't make much sense, and it is hard to read. The graph doesn't do the one thing graphs are meant to do, it makes the information harder to understand thanthe raw data.
