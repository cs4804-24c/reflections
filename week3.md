This article is about the history of data visualization. It begins by explaining that the earliest 
data visualizations were maps, but demand for more accurate and complex maps increased which resulted in the 
need for better visualizations. It provides a picture of the firtst known data viz, which was a one dimensional
chart represeting logitude between Toledo and Rome. The 18th century was when more thematic mapping occured 
and data was made to be visual as opposed to bieng in simple charts. The article expalains that the golden age of 
visualizations happened because of multiple factors: the insdustrial revolution, official government statistical offices,
and an increasing recogniction of the importance of numerical data in many aspects of life. This article is interesting
becuase it shows parts of data visualization that are hardly thought about. The fact that many common forms of data vis,
such as line, bar, circle, and pie charts, are as useful for representing data now as they were when they were created.
I think it is intersting to see the chronological order of certain visualizations becuase it reveales how people think.
The first data vis tools were maps, which makes sense as the most ubiquatous visual tool of its time becuase
maps can represents information about vast amounts land while being able to fit on a piece of paper, or in an atlas.
Maps are useful in a way other data visulazations are not becuase it represents physical things as opposed to
things like numbers ad ideas.
