For this week's reflection, I looked at an interactive visualization created by David McCandless & Tom Evans about the world's biggest data
breaches and hacks (any events with over 30,000 records stolen were included). This visualization is both exciting and interactive, conveying
a lot of information in one visualization without putting too many words on the screen at once. The data used contained the magnitude of the
data breach, which is represented by the size of the circle containing that breach's information. While humans are not perfect at telling
the difference between shapes of different areas, the large differences in the areas of these circles makes it clear to the reader which
breaches have been the most extreme. When hovering over a circle, the user is provided with additional information about the breach, even
being given the option to 'click to read more,' bringing them to an externel website to read a more detailed article about the breach if
available. I think this is a great way to allow readers to go in depth about areas that they are interested in within the visualization
without overwhelming the reader with a lot of information at once. The data used also contained the date of the breach, which the creators
used to place each of the circles on a timeline. As you scroll down, it is clear to see that there are fewer and fewer breaches the farther
you go back, showing that data breaches and hacks are a very prevalent issue. This timeline is paired with the color saturation of the circles
changing as the user scrolls to more/less recent years. Having less saturation for older breaches seems like a good choice for the visualization,
as the user is likely more interested in recent events. The visualization also offers 'filter' and 'search' options,
which allow the reader to filter on sector of the attack, method of the attack, or search up specific companies/ groups. I think the search
option is a great way to help users get familiar with the data, as they can search up apps such as Instagram and LinkedIn that they commonly
use to see if there have potentially been breaches of their own data. 

My first suggestion is to move all the relevant circles up to the top of the screen when the user filters/ searches for something in particular.
Currently, as shown in the figure below with a search for 'Instagram,' the filter options simply make the non-relevant circles shrink and lighten in saturation, forcing the reader to scroll through the 
entire visualization looking for circles that are still relevant. This can make the reader less engaged or make them feel like they have missed
something. I also think that the creators could make better use of the visual channels of color hue and saturation. Currently, it appears that
a yellow circle indicates an interesting story. While this may be good for some, not all users have the same interests. As we learned in class,
we are very quick to recognize when something is a different color than what is around it, meaning that these yellow circles are going to stand
out to everyone, including users who may not be interested in those topics. I feel that color could be used in a more informative way, such as 
having color correspond to the type of breach, location of the hackers, or sector of the attack. If the creators want to continue using only two 
colors, they could potentially give users an option to select interests and have the relevant circles turn yellow.
