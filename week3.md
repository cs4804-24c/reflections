Steve Franconeri's Thinking with Data Visualizations, Fast and Slow
may provide insight into how data visualization integrates with our
cognitive processes, echoing Daniel Kahneman's dual-process theory.
This work roughly explores the balance between intuitive System 1
visualizations, which allow rapid data understanding, and more
complex System 2 visualizations, which require thoughtful analysis.
Reflecting on this, the importance of data visualization design
becomes apparent, not only in its ability to convey information
effectively, but also in its potential to mislead or overwhelm.
Franconeri's insights highlight the important role of cognition in data
interpretation, emphasizing the need for visualizations that are
accessible and accurate, customized to the context in which they are
used, whether in fast-paced decision-making scenarios or detailed
academic research. This approach highlights the subtle relationship
between data presentation and our mental processing of data,
providing a valuable perspective for both creators and consumers of data visualizations.
