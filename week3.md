This chart utilizes data regarding the global distribution of total plastic waste generation across continents. Jamie Kettle initiated this personal project to estimate the proportion of inadequately disposed plastic waste. The infographic offers a clear and concise depiction of the current surface plastic mass in oceans, presented in a creative manner. Plastic waste management for each country is visually represented through a colored bar chart, with countries reporting 100% proper handling of plastic waste highlighted in bold. A notable discovery from this analysis is the lack of a consistent correlation between a country's GDP and efficient plastic waste management, as evidenced by the irregular patterns depicted in the infographic. Some contries like America supposedly adequatley manage all of their plastic. I find this statistic hard to beleive and am curious to know what the defenition is for inadequately managed share of plastic. Regardless, I also like the representation of the amount of plastic found in various oceans represented equivalent weight in number of blue whales. This really helps give a better idea of just how much plastic is in our oceans.
