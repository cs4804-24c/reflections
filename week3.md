For this week I was intrested in looking at different network diagrams/graphs to see if I could find any intresting ones. 
I ended up finding this one https://flowingdata.com/2015/12/15/a-day-in-the-life-of-americans/ which is kind of a variation of a network graph.
This author Nathon Yau took data from the american time use survey and caculated propabilities of activaties of americans through out the day.
Then from that he created a simulatiion on a graph representing a 1000 americans days. Each dot represents a paerson and each color represents
and activity. As the day moves on you can see the dots bounce around from activity to activity giving you an idea of how much time americans 
spend on each activaty throughout the day. Now depending on the speed you select it can be hard to tell what is going on, so Yau in is 
article also icluded some network graphs of some key times of the day in order to provided a more static representation of what is going on
and even guven a description. Overall, I believe this was an intresting transformation of data. Instead of just taking the raw data and 
making some simple charts or diagrams Yau worked with the data to provided a visualization that goes a bit further. He spent time calculating 
ptopablities of certain activities through out the day and then from there he was able to create an intresting simulation visualization.
