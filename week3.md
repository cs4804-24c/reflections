This week, I found an interesting visualization from Reddit breaking down Microsoft's different sources of income. This visualization felt extremely jarring to me, because it strayed away from the minimalism theme I am used to seeing in data vis. This visualization is a donut chart with different images and logos for each entry, and it is extremely busy. I think this visulization would work better if it were simplified, like making each entry just one color with the logo on it. The background is also extremely distracting, it is a stock photo without the watermark removed. Surprisingly, this visualization seemed to be pretty popular on the r/DataIsBeautiful subreddit, as it has over 4,000 upvotes (as of now), and noboody in the comments seems to be voicing any displeasure with how the data is presented.
