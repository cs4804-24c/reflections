This visualization is something that I have never seen before. The representation of the data has never been portrayed this way that I know of. This visualization is about gravitational waves and how over time the ripples have caused violent collisons of black holes dating back to billion of years. It includes sound bites for some mergers and there is animations to make the visual more interactive. There is also a pop-up model when clicking the merger to show more detailed information. Since this is a innvoative way to present the data I like the instructions on reading this visual or I would not have know how to read it. Within each extra information discusses what mereger it is and linking to the original articles that it references. The choice of color is revelvent to the data that is presenting which is space and astrotogical based information. The sound is an interesting feature since I would have never thought it would sound like a "blip". I also noticed and mentioned in the article that the further it is away from earth the loger it takes for the merger to occur. Though I don't understand the extend of what it means for solor mass in this context, someone who has more experience would understand the difference. Also the positions of the merger indicated how close it was to each other. However something that I would change is that the timeline starts from the past and move its way to the present. Since moving backwards does not explain the progession whereas moving from the past to the present makes it seen that one merger after another is the cause of the previous mereger.
