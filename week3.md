My reflection for this week may be slightly unorthodox given the usual requirements, my submission is a video animation of the visualization of size comparisons for things in the universe. I found this YouTube visualization by Kurzgesagt fascinating, not only due to my bias as a subscriber to their YouTube channel. For as long as I have been a Kurzgesagt viewer, the informative video stories have vivid and richly saturated coloring with complex animation that fills numerous different video lengths. Attached in the reflection is the link for this week's FlowingData blog, where the blog post is titled "The Scale of all the Things Compared to You," and the Kurzgesagt video is titled "You Are The Center of The Universe (Literally)." The twelve-minute-thirty-second-long video discusses the concept of size scaling on two fronts: big and small things. Kurzgesagt is a well-known channel with 21.7 million subscribers. Their objective in this video is to scale everything in the universe in comparison to their average viewer. The visualization of the measurements of things measured is beautifully animated to exponentially grow with the concept of the power of 10 in the positive or negative direction depending on the thing talked about. Kurzgesagt focuses on a stark shadowing method of color theory to portray their graphics, and their range of animation goes from linear motion to the facade of three-dimensional movement. I find the flow, bounce, and precision of the visualization are at a level that I cannot achieve and therefore cannot give much more critique for. The image below is an example of what I attempt to describe in terms of scaling, and the placement of lines, numbers, images, image movement, and color are all captivating and I truly am swept into continuing to intake the data being presented to me.
