This is a colored map of mortality rates in the US by county. The first thing that stuck out to me was the color choice: dragging the timeline slider back to 1980 looks really grim. Clicking through the causes of death, however, changes the color scheme. I wonder what the thought process was behind picking colored groups of reasons that people died.

If you mess with the slider after selecting HIV/AIDS you can watch the epidemic spread and then become better contained.

I clicked through causes of death until I reached the last one: Tuberculosis. What immediately stuck out to me was how BAD some of South Dakota looked! I immediately Googled "Tuberculosis South Dakota," expecting to reveal some horrifying statistic about a small town that's been ravaged by TB in the 2010s. Instead, I found nothing remarkable. Then I looked at the legend in the bottom of the graph: 3 deaths per 100,000 people.

Sure, this is a local maximum so it should stand out. Maybe this is my own, limited data literacy telling me that I should be reading legends more carefully. I think the average person would see a dark spot on this map and worry for the people of South Dakota. That said, I can't think of a better way to communicate the data on a map. Maybe we don't need to clearly highlight these counties at all?
