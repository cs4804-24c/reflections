Week 3 Reflection

This graph/data shows the total population and annual population growth rate in China. This data was interesting to me
as it showed that the population of China decreasing and shrinks for a second year in a row. The graph is presented in 
a unqiue way, using both a bar chart to show the total population and a line graph to show the annual growth rate. In addition,
the colors were really well thought out, and fits with the theme/data that its displaying. The colors red and yellow represent
that of the Chinese flag, which I believe helps the reader immediately understand and see what the graph is about. Also, I liked
how they showed the data and population numbers for 2023, as this gives the audience just enough information to understand
what the trend is like in recent years.

While, the graph is great, there are some improvements that could be made. Firstly, it could be confusing to the audience how the 
left side of the graph goes by decades (1970, 1980, 1990, 2000, etc) and the right side goes by years (2020, 2021, 2022, 2023). The
audience could easily overlook that, and that could misrepresent the data. In addition, its missing years from 2010 to 2020. Leaving
those years out could be done on purpose to construe the data and push a narrative. However, in my opinion, leaving information like 
this out could give the data and what its trying to represent less credibility, as there are missing holes in the data. With that
said I think the overall graph/data is great, the graph is visually nice, and its also simple, easy to understand, and straight
to the point.
