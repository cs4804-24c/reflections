Title: Hereâ€™s every total solar eclipse happening in your lifetime. Is this year your best chance?

This vis shows the upcoming solar eclipses in our life, especially highlighting the one that came up in 8/2017 (as this came out then). The most interesting part of this vis to me is that it's interactive and visualizes the data very well, showing the path of eclipses spanning the timeline of the next few decades. It's cool to see how the paths cross each other and we cane see which areas are and aren't covered. The visualization itself is quite clean and gives a professional look, which isn't surprising since this is from The Washington Post. The eclipses closer to us in time are more saturated in color, which allows the viewer to easily identify which ones they'll see in the near future. 

On top of that, they have smaller unique details, like specific zoom-in cases of cities that have seen more eclipses than others. Similar to that is that they have a map of the U.S. where all paths have overlapped to essentially create a heatmap of where eclipses are the most popular. Other details like land vs water coverage add a great touch as well.

As for some improvements, I think they could add some extra details that are explained in the article, such as the umbra and penumbra, along with tooltips, so as to give the reader a more holistic understanding of eclipses and what not. But, I could imagine the downside of that would be a cluttered vis, which wouldn't be as pleasing to look at as the current one.
