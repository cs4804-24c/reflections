This Sankey diagram breaks down Microsoft's revenue in the June 2022 quarter, and where the money went. I have never seen a Sankey diagram applied this way to track a company's revenue, and I think it simply achieves its goal.

I chose this graphic because I can see it being shown to higher ups in a meeting and it being easily understandable. The big titles of the sections with the monetary value underneath it allows for the viewer to follow along. Also, the red to show money spent and the parentheses around the number shows that the value is negative. I also think it is visually pleasing to have the logos of the products that made the revenue. However, I am a little confused about the fourth tier with the blue, yellow, and grey. From my understanding, Microsoft 365 had a 44% gross profit error, Azure had 42%, and Windows had 32%. This was unclear to me at first due to the revenue color being the same color as the Microsoft 365 color. 

It seems they have made this Sankey to avoid the overlapping of lines. They provide the percentages of gross profit for the different products, but I think it could have been valuable to have the sections break down into the operating expenses. For example, it is not clear that Azure had the highest operating expense and Microsoft 365 had the lowest.
