Hierarchical edge bundling graphs allows us to show the adjacency relations between entities in a hierarchy. Actually it is a technique that groups edges that are close to each other into bundles. This reduces the number of individual edges that need to be displayed Which makes the visualizations more simplified. This helps with the decrease of the clutter which is observed in complex networks. Actually hierarchical edge bundling reduces clutter in visuals and is considered as a generic method that can also be used in conjunction with tree visualization techniques. Edge bundling has an application on maps. The use of edge bundling on maps does not need a hierarchy and uses a self organizing approach to bundling. This graph shows the use of edge bundling on a map which visualizes the flights between airports in the USA. The code can be modified to show the top 50 airports by degree or the highest degree airport in the USA. This type of visualization helps with the traffic network, with nodes showing airports and edges showing the amount of flights between nodes. With the use of this visualization, it would be easier to identify patterns in data.
