For this week I decieded to look for one of the classic map visualizations and I landed on this one 
https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/12/28/us/migrants-children-data.html. This article si about where migrant children are working in the US.
Overall it is a good read on a current and often debated topic. I always find these visualization intresting as I can never really tell if they
are fair to the data.  What I mean is looking at the graphh the legend is small amount per 100,000 , for some scenarios this can lead to a
senstialized visualization where it is making a bigger deal then it is. Although this is article is about migrant children working so it seems
to fit better especially if the migrant children are underaged and working. However, overall I would say these types of visuals are useful. 
Especially when paired with other graphs, and in this case it was a line chart and bar chart.
