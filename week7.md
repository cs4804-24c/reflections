Reflection:
This week I chose an article from the New York Times titled "How Every Member Got to Congress." I really liked this 
visualization. I like how they split up the democrats and the republicans by color using the color that corresponded to 
their party. I also really like how when you hover over the vis it highlights the path that you are hovering over. I 
also like the dropdown section that allows you to select an exact representative you want to look at. One thing that I 
did not like was how they used different sized circles throughout the vis, but did not explain what they mean. I assume
that the different sized circles mean more or less paths go through it, but nowhere in the vis does it have a key for 
circle size. Another thing I did not like was how the milestones are no in chronological order. I feel like this is 
misleading to the reader because just by quickly looking at the vis you would assume it is sort of like a timeline. 
Another thing I did not like as that the list of milestones was not exhaustive. I know it would be very difficult to 
make it exhaustive, but I feel like there is a lot missing from the list. A final thing that I did not like was the 
distance from the center of the circles. By looking at the vis there seems as though there would be some sort of meaning 
behind how far in the circle are, but it does not say anywhere that there is. This again feels misleading because it 
feels as though there is meaning behind it.
