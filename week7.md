AI Timelines - Our World In Data

https://ourworldindata.org/ai-timelines

For this week's reflection, I chose an article and corresponding visualizations covering the timeline of human-level artificial intelligence in the future.
The data here is a survey conducted by multiple groups asking experts in AI how long they believe it will take to have a 50% chance of an AI that surpasses humans.
Here, "surpassing humans" is defined as an AI that is "able to do anything a human can do" better and more cheaply than a human. 
In the visualizations, each line represents an answer that an expert gave. This allows the reader to see groupings in the data as well as identify overarching trends in the answers that experts gave.
According to the latest data, about 50% of experts believe that there will be AI surpassing humans by 2060, and 90% believe there will be AI surpassing humans within the next century. 
The second visualization compares the latest results with results from a 2019 study and a 2018 study. It is quite obvious from these visualizations that the recent developments in AI have made experts expect human-level AI sooner than it was expected just a few years ago. 
I chose this visualization for a few reasons. Firstly, I believe that these visualizations are a really good way to represent this type of study with a wide range of variance in user responses. One of the later visualizations in the article uses a box-and-whisker, and in my opinion something like this is losing a lot of potential insights. As an example, one can see in the 2022 survey that there were large groups of respondents that answered around the early 2040s, mid 2060s, and mid 2070s. Without having a line for each individual survey response, these types of groupings would usually be lost.
Another reason is that I think this article is very good at describing the results for what they actually are. They are completely transparent that most of the experts had a very low uncertainty in their responses, and even gave examples of experts being completely wrong about predictions in their field about past technologies.
Finally, I wanted to show off this visualization type in general, since it's not really something I have seen before and it seems like a great way to represent the type of time-based survey question that was asked here.
