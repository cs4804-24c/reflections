This visualization shows how users purchase phones from different device providers. This visualization utilizes animation to first build the story and set the scene. It also explains the data as it appears. It has a whole separate step to show people changing between brands, it breaks down the story into segments and allows the user to process what they just saw. While the text is on a timer, the user can also reset, skip, or go to the source directly. When it begins to show. Additionally, when the visualization is showing more than just a piechart, it allows the viewer to control when to move on, giving them time to process as needed. It also helps when it flashes the percentage of the breakdown, bringing the user's attention there. By doing so, it builds upon explaining how to actually read the chord diagram, even clarifying the color of the chords signifying that one company has taken more from the other. I also find the color palette to be quite nice. It stays as true to the brand as it can, but due to overlap, it makes the next best choice while still matching the others. Adding the interactiveness of showing only the brand you hover over also really helps with reading the visual, but this is all because it really walks you through how to read and interpret.
