The visualization that I chose this week is an interactive budget simulator for the Federal Government's budget. There is a lot I like about this site, I feel like it displays all the information that I want to know and breaks it down in a concise way. On top of that, it is interactive, and allows you to change values to see how it would be different if the Federal Government spent money differently. This creates a balancing act between choosing how much money is gained through revenue and how much is spent. I like that it splits it up into different categories, including: Health Care, Social Security, Defense, and more. Each of these categories have more categories within that are adjustable. I also like how some extra variables can be adjusted, such as the retirement age can be adjusted. The spending is dynamically represented using a pie chart. I would not usually like this, but the chart is based on the values that are chosen by the user so I think it helps to give more perspective to the values. Overall, the way the visualization is laid out on the page and the information that is presented makes it very intuitive to understand and interact with.
