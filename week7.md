Link to the DataWrapper blog article, "Sex and the census", with a visualization that I read: https://blog.datawrapper.de/gender-ratio-american-history/


Visualization Reflection:

In this data visualization article, author and DataWrapper visualization team member Rose Mintzer-Sweeney discusses the ratio of women to men in different social settings and institutions in the United States. The second visualization in this article caught my attention, which is a geospatial map showing US Census data in 2010 titled "Men outnumber women in the West, in prisons, and in resource extraction." This geospatial map is reasonably well-designed and provides interesting data that paints a picture of the ratios of women to men in every county of the United States. First, a useful design feature included in this geospatial map is a green-purple scale with corresponding colors mapped to the United States. This scale is highly informative to the user when they first see the map because it is immediately obvious which counties have a greater number of men (green) and which ones have a greater number of women (purple). In addition to the color scale at the bottom-right corner of the geospatial map, there is also a zoom control, which improves the user experience as it enables one to observe and compare the women-to-men ratio through a close-up of US counties. The most interesting design feature included in this geospatial map is by far the tooltip. When the user hovers over any of the counties, a tooltip pops up displaying not only the number of women compared to the number of men in the county, but also a mini-barchart visualization. This mini-barchart is highly informative because it communicates to the user the number of excess women per one hundred men in the selected county. Essentially, this mini-barchart is the visual representation of the women-to-men ratio listed towards the top of the tooltip box. Overall, this is an interesting geospatial map due to its simple yet effective design choices and engaging subject matter.
