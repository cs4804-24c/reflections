This visualization is about "How Every Member Got to Congress" written by Sahil Chinoy and Jessia Ma. This visual focuses on understanding how the Unites States have has several different types of people ending up in Congress. Specifically showcasing the different representatives and how each journey is different to obtain a spot in Congress, whether it is a democratic or republican representatives. Some interesting aspects of this visual is that it has a dropdown for every representative and focus on the journey. Also, another interesting cool features of this visual is that when scrolling around it will highlight a specific line and how the representative name and the major academic or career acheivements that they have. The black circles are for those who are have completed a specific degree or had a certain career. Even scrolling through within the black outlined circle makes it easier to find and see all the representatives who might have had a speciic degree or job. Within the graph it is breaken down to Undergraduate, Graduate, Career, Government. Of all the caree I would not have expected to see that representatives were a religious leader, doctor or even into farming and ranching. But the one that suprsied me the most was those in blue-collar or service job since it is every hard to convert from this specific career into something else like obtaining a government post. The color choice speaks o the political demographic that they are trying to showcase. The options to seen the same information in different forms makes it easier to understand.
