This bar graph is about the amount of Unicorn (Companies with a valuation over 1 billion dollars)startups from the US started by first generation immigrants from different countries. It is a left to right reading chart, with the number of unicorns created on the right
and the flag and name of the country they are from on the left. Its incredible easy to read listing the top 10 countries being listed from the greatest to the least from the top to the bottom. The graph is
also very colorful. The background is yellow which contrasts heavily with the red bars. Additionally the background also contrasts with the text used as well as the flags in the graph. Its also a nice 
touch that they add a source for the data in the bototm left as well as including the source of the graph in the top right. There are some funny takeaways from this graph, like the fact that immigrants
from countries that start with the letter 'i' make up about 49% of the founders of unicorn startups in the US. All in all this is a pretty cool graph.
