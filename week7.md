While my previous reflection focused on examining the principles of data visualization within the context of front-end development, this article delves into the
implications of a full-stack approach to software engineering. I think that it is interesting that the visualization capabilities for backend projects is much more
complex than front-end, allowing techniques such as GIS mapping, for example. They also show the vast library of visualization tools that Python is able to interface
with, such as Matplotlib, and compatibility with libraries in R, for example. Furthermore, the authors of the article show how using Flask within Python is primarily 
utilized with an object-oriented programming approach. Overall, my general impression is that there are different implications on the output of data visualization 
techniques depending on the scope of the project.
