This visualization shows the bodies of water that these 10 rivers flow into. I appreciate the use of a Sankey diagram to visualize this, as it is very intuitive and not only visualizes the information but nature itself. The left side river information flows into the right side larger bodies of water. I also like the interactive abilities, where you can hover over the river and see where it is on a map. It has additional information such as the length of the river. I would love to see this map scaled larger for more data. While the blue helps the visualization look like a river, it can mix the view of overlapping rivers. However, river data can be isolated so it is not much of a problem.
