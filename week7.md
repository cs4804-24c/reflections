I was drawn to this one because I really like the layout of the bars. You can compare both vertically and horizontally which is nice, and especially if you almost tilt your head to the side it's like there's a bunch of bar charts showing how each category changed over time.
That combined with the font, color palette, and background color makes it very pleasant to look at and understand. I also am glad the little notes section is there at the bottom. It clarified most of the questions I had initially. 
The only thing that slightly confused me at first was the use of different colors for different types of deaths, and I'm still not entirely sure what that corresponds to. Also, there is one small visual inconsistency, where there's one bar marked 50% in light font inside the bar, instead of dark font outside the bar. Pretty minor, but it does draw my attention straight to that bar which I don't think was intentional.
Some interesting trends immediately jump out, like how health issues have dropped significantly, and the weird spike of "unknown" deaths in the 2020s. I'm honestly pretty surprised at how relatively stable drugs are, and it's nice to see the slight decrease since the 70s and 80s.
I wasn't really sure what "travel" meant at first, but the comments clarified that it was vehicle-related deaths. The spike in the 60s is very strange to me and I'm sure there's a tragic story there. And I feel like the decrease in the 2020s has to be due to the fact that they're not over yet, but I'm not sure.
Violence is another interesting one. The dramatic difference between the 2010s and 2020s is pretty shocking to see, especially since it hadn't been that low for quite a few decades. I wonder what was going on in the 2010s. It's occuring to me now that since these are percentages and not just straight numbers, it's hard to tell from this visualization alone whether there was "more" of a certain type of death or not. That would be useful to include.
I'm glad to see an unknown category, especially since deaths can only be listed in one category. It makes me wonder why the causes are unknown. Is it because they just haven't figured it out yet? Or is it because people don't want that information to be public? 
I would assume it's a combination of both, since the big spike in the 2020s could reflect deaths that haven't fully been investigated or disclosed yet. And also since the friends or relatives of the dead are more likely to be alive still, maybe they would prefer if the cause wasn't revealed, in the case that it was embarassing or shameful.
Overall this is a very cool visualization to explore. My favorite thing about it is the way it prompts additional research, to answer some of the questions relating to increases or decreases. It's informative but doesn't try to tell the whole story, because it can't.
