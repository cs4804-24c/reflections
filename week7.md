This visualization comes from an article in The Pudding about the frequency of different words used in headlines for articles surrounding women. For the purposes 
of this reflection, I looked at the last two visualizations in the article as you scroll down. The first of these is a chart showing the frequency of different words 
compared across different countries, such as India, the US, South Africa, and the UK. I found this interesting first because of the differences and similarities that exist 
across the countries. I think this graph does a good job of showing that due to the use of tooltips, as well as different colors showing different themes that the words
have been categorized into. As you mouse over a particular bar representing a word, the graph grays out any other word, allowing you to see the rank of the specific word
across all of the countries, which I think is very striking visually. The second visualization is a stacked bar chart showing the most common words and their frequencies
organized by theme. I enjoy this chart because it also grays out the surrounding words when you mouse over a particular section, but also due to the tooltips. You can see
a concrete number of how many times this particular word has been used since 2005, which I feel like is a needed metric, since the prior visualization didn't contain
any sort of number or scale for the shown frequencies. As a final word, I really enjoy the written analysis that accompanies this last visualization, that "for every 
occurrence of an empowering word, we read two words of crime and violence."
