For this weeks reflection I chose a visualization from the dataisbeautiful Reddit page titled 
[_6 month job app process of a teacher trying to break into tech_](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/1ap5m6q/oc_6_month_job_app_process_of_a_teacher_trying_to/)

This is a small Sankey diagram showing a timeline of the job application process of this Reddit user. I like how this graph clearly shows the application and interview process, having a unique line for every difference. 
This shows how uncommon it is to have more than 3 rounds of interviews, hence there was only one job that had a 4th and 5th round interview. It's interesting to see that the user only got job offers after the third round 
of interviews, and how they varied in offer type. Two of them were verbal offers which were rescinded, and the only written offer was accepted. While I haven't filled out this many job applications, I find it surprising how many 
companies didn't give any response at all. It seems strange that a company would leave an application as pending/no answer instead of rejecting the applicant. Regarding the design of this graph, I'm confused as to why 
referrals have their own spot after the application, in the same area as first-round interview. I think it could make more sense to be on the same line for all applications, and break it down based on where they found the 
job application (LinkedIn, referrals, etc.). Additionally, I am wondering if it's common to go with this top-down approach, with the largest result starting on top and descending in value until the lowest result is reached (accepted offer). 
Lastly, I think the colors could've been a bit better for this, as some colors are similar, such as the rejection category and third-round interview. This can make it a little confusing to understand the graph, especially if the user 
were to include a colorized legend.
