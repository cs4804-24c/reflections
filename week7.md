This visualization is about wine pairings with various food groups. This visualization caught my eye due to the colors 
and images used to convery the data. From the different animals to vegtables the images show which food they are talking about 
and then are connected to a labeled wine bottle with a distinct colored line. Not only is the art of wine pairing fascinating but
the visualization made me one to learn even more. It was designed and colored in a simple manner where a little kid could understand it.
they avoided the use of words as much as possible which also breaks the language barrier for more people to comprehend it.
