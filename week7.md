This week I came across this website. I really love the visualizatiosn they used and how it ties in with human anatomy. I think we often times overlook how complex our bodies
are and these visualizations provide a better understanding of what goes on. I also did research on some of the best tools to do network visualization with.
The first tool mentioned (Gephi) really caught my eye and is something I eventually want to use in a project. Overall I think network visualization looks amazing but very complex to understand
