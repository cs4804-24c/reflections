This visualization is a lengthy one, a story that is scrolled through while data, visualizations, and text are displayed along the way. The story told is an excellent one, moving through the aspects of Health Inclusivity around the world, from the initial index to the portions that make it up, peoples real experience, and how inclusivity is not necessarily linked to wealth. Showing how the data stratified by region and income is interesting as well. Bright highlighted text is used to emphasize the portions of the data being discussed by the text, easily visually linking to the brightly colored boxes. The amount of data and topics addressed is impressive. In addition most sections have some additional interactivity, allowing boxes to be moused over to tell what country they represent, and that country's exact score. My only major dislike is that the visualization is not formatted quite right for my laptop screen. It might have been optimized for mobile users. Parts of the visualization tend to be below the window of the browser, out of sight. In addition, parts of the Policy section (part 2 of the visualization) lacks interactivity.
