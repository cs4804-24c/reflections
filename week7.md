Reflection:

Kenneth Field created an interesting infographic using Nasa's data about eclipses.
The infographic shows information about where the eclipse had its highest coverage as well as the time of day that it peaked.
What I think the infographic did really well was filling in the empty spaces with extra information for a viewer to see.
For example it shows a visual about what an eclipse is and the different eclipses that happened. 
My favorite part about the chart however is the shape of the visualization.
I really like that they portrayed this with eclipses shaped into the map of the US.
It allowed easy identification on locations, and with this layout, it also allowed for time periods for the eclipses as well.
The only thing I disliked about it is the text on the border of the infographic.
It was very hard to read since the bottom text is upside down with the side text being sideways.
However I do think it adds a nice design to the graphic.
