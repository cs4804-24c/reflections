For the final visualization reflection, it would be interesting to apply my knowledge of GIS and geospatial visualization to this GPS map of Seattle, WA, which analyzes public locations and their relative distances according to time. I find this to be a very well-designed visualization, the article attached is a description of the design and technical features a user can interact with, with clearly labeled interactive list items and a nice fixed legend on the map. It may be an issue on my computer's end, but the map zoom and toggle features may have a little latency. The math that goes behind calculations of the distances I'm sure is extremely complex and impressive, I don't think I would change anything about that. If my MQP has taught me anything, then it is possible to improve the rendering speed of updated visualizations, and I would apply that knowledge by implementing a caching strategy or other optimization method where applicable to improve the refresh time and map rendering time when zooming or reconfiguring the toggle options. In a future edition of this work, I would hope to link the data to a worldwide or at least national set of data to then apply to the entire state or the entire country--what are the limits of this? What other public locations are not shown on this list that can be visited within 30 minutes? I would be curious to see the extent to which the 15-minute city concept is limited as well as expanded. Antique stores? Pharmacies? Shopping centers? If there are none in the city then how far away is it? I think this visualization has the potential to be at the level of a new generation of GPS when asking the right questions and growing it further. It would also be cool for each city block when highlighted or clicked on--which is a feature already well-made in this visualization--to show the streets that they are part of, say, 4th and Main to 5th and Broadway in New York, for example. This visualization is important and significant for the world's carbon footprint as well, and if it were a map-like software for the general public to use it would easily show the eager and busy population the nearest convenient locations to reach within their preferred distance; encouraging them to partake in either a walk or public transportation. This would work best in larger urban areas of course, which is why it is tested through this viz in Seattle.
