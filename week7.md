This project visualizes various daily activities that might have been affected by pandemic in 2020. Each chart shows the median time spent for the activity each year, as well as showing the 60th/40th percentile for the spread of data from the ATUS. It took me a minute to understand what the charts were displaying since it's a little different from your traditional bar chart or node graph where you're familiar with it and you can understand it from a quick glance. The activities are sorted by change in time, descending order.

As for some analysis on certain activities, there are definitely some that stick out. For example, I was exteremely surprised to see working out at the top of the list. My opinion for this is mainly influenced by the stereotype that people are motivated to work out as a new year's resolution, but most fall off since they've failed to build a sustainable lifestyle. I thought this was the case for the pandemic as well, but as I'm thinking of it right now, it could also be the fact that it was a great enough timeframe to build such lifestyle. However, the graph begins at 2019 instead of 2020, so that's even more interesting, since from 2019-2020, it actually dropped ~10%. I'd definitely be interested to understand why this is the case.

I've reflected on vis' by the same author, and I have the same criticisms, that it would be helpful to include some of his insights/summaries, but now that I know he's making all of these, he probably is just mass producing these. Probably not something he's interested in doing.
