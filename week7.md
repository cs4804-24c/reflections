This visualization is focused on when people tend to Google search different food items throughout the year. This data visualization is a radial year clock chart, which allows the viewer to see the interest in the food item throughout different seasons and years. Each year, from 2004-2016, is color coded. The radius, so where the segment is in the circle, is the amount of searches, meaning the closer to the center the less searches. Some interesting trends were certain foods being searched whenever they were in season. A beginning of the year trend that was fun to see was people searching up smoothies in January - for people pursuing the “new year new me” mentality. I liked that the visualization had notes to highlight certain trends that explained the random increase of interest. For instance, mint julep had an increase in searches during the end of May due it being the official drink of the Kentucky Derby. I think the visualization overall does a good job at highlighting trends in food searches, and I specially liked the context it provides. This is a visualization I would like to recreate, so it’s nice to know that it was created using d3.
