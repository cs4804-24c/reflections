This visual examines 4 different focuses of countries in the world. Pictured above is the page visualizing development. 

I like this visual because there is a lot of information well organized and clearly explained. Face value of this visual is that it looks pretty, but you are not sure what you are looking at. Once the user clicks on the legend the second picture shown appears. This does a good job of explaining what metrics are shown, and an explanation of them. Once the user understands the legend they can go back to the main visual and understand what they are looking at and make comparisons. One thing it lacks is labels of the countries. The user must hover over the leaf to see what country it corresponds to, and it also shows the exact measures for the country. The user can also click to read more about the country which is shown in the third photo. The leaves are grouped by region in the world which is helpful to locate the desired country. Another aspect I like is the aggregate measures at the root of the tree.

One thing that I wish they labeled is what region corresponds to each branch, but including this the visual could make it crowded. 

The last visual shown is from clicking on the lines above the tree. This visual looks at the google searches of key terms and writes summaries and predictions for this topic.
