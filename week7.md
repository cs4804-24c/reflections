https://flowingdata.com/2019/09/13/sleep-schedule-and-age/

This chart highlights the escalating issue of sleeplessness with age, leveraging insights from the American Time Use Survey data spanning from 2014 to 2018. The author uses both real data and personal experinces on the challenges of maintaining a sound sleep cycle, citing reasons such as bathroom visits, children's nightmares, and temperature discomfort. The chart shows a clear trend in reported sleeplessness percentages. Especially after the age of 30, signifying an age-related increase in nocturnal disruption. The first chart displays the binary color scheme (yellow for awake, magenta for asleep) and reveals subtle fluctuations, particularly around college age and retirement. In this graph the age range is from 0 childhood to 80+ eternity which i found very intresting. The second chart employs a gradient color scale, offering a more subtle view of sleep schedules. It indicates less consistent sleep patterns during early years, more consistent sleep among older individuals, and wider bands in later years suggesting a more consistent sleeping schedule and later wake-up times. The author was suprised to see the wider bands in later years, hinting at a more stable sleep schedule and later waking times. I choose this article because as a college student I can relate to having a messed up sleep schedule. Often times I go to bed after 12 and have to wake up early for 8am classes.
