This website showcases the same simple data set in 100 different ways. Each visualization shows
the number of world heritage sites in Norway, Denmark, and Sweden in the years 2004 and 2022, 
which is a total of six separate data points. These different visualization range from simple
charts, to more complex visualizations such as #40, which depicts an axis that looks like steps, 
an arch with its endpoints landing on the data values for each country. Not all of these graphs
are as useful as each other though. For example, #67 is interesting, but it doesn't convey the 
information as smoothly as a bar of pie charts might. Another that stands out as not being 
the best use of a certain type of graph is number 86. It shows multiple overlapping rectangles that
create a venn diagram, but it seems like much of the "ink" in this visualization is wasted or 
useless. One of the graphs that stand out as being helpful for understanding the data is 
#97. It allows for easy comparison of growth and totals within the data.
