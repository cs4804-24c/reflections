This spider chart aids in evaluating players' abilities across various facets of the game. Each axis represents a rating from 0 to 100, determined solely by the available statistics. Clicking on the axis names reveals the statistics utilized in calculating each score. I think that this is a very interesting chart to mess around with. You can compare aspects such as playmaking, clutchness, shooting, scoring, offensive aggressiveness, defensive aggressiveness, go-to-guy, and catch and shooting. Kyrie Irving is one of my favorite players to watch so I compared home with a few players to mess around with the chart. I noticed that the chart is somewhat limited. I was hoping to be able to filter through more selections of stats and aspects of players games. The website is only limited to the 8 stats mentioned above. It would be nice to be able to compare more basic stats such as assists instead of playmaking which lumps together assists and steals. It currently doesnt give as many options as I was hoping for but nonetheless I still found it useful and interesting.
