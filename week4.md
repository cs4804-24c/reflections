Summary: The graphic showcases all the countries that recognize Israel, Palestine, and both across the globe. This graphic is relevant since we are currently facing the Israeli Palestinian conflict. 

Reflection: One nice thing about this visualization is that it goes into detail about each country in the world and the color coding for each recognition class makes it easy to see the results without spending much time looking at the graphic. I liked the supporting text (the text on the graphic and the supporting explanation of it) as it allows the user to get into more detail as needed without being overwhelmed. One thing that I would change about this graphic would be the data source as they used Wikipedia data from 2014 which may not be the most accurate source. I appreciate that the graphic is timely but it would be nice to go along with some other information as the volume of data represented did not necessarily call for a relatively complex graphic - the supporting chart shown below the graphic is a more condensed way to represent the data which makes it more searchable.
