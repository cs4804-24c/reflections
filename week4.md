This stacked bar chart overtime shows the daily routine of famous creative people.

I thought the use of stacked bar charts overtime was unique. I like how it allows me to see at 12pm how the people spent their time. Additionally, the colors in the key can act as filters, and you can filter on more than one action at a time. This allows the user to see the total time spent on different activities a bit more easily. Also the colors are straight forward and not misleading. Red for creative work was smart as this is what the audience is most interested in as we are viewing how creative people spend their time. Another feature I like about this graphic is the info circles next to the names that explain who the people are. This provides a lot of context to the data.

As with most bar charts it is hard to see the grand total of sections, especially in this case when sections can be split up. Its hard to see how long John MIlton spent sleeping compared to Benjamin Franklin. A feature that I wish was present would be the ability to filter on people, so the user could more easily compare the people they desire.
