In contrast to the widespread adversity faced by most businesses in 2020, this data visualization highlights a significant growth surge for Big Tech. The rise in demand for various digital services, driven by the remote work trend, contributed to this positive trend. The visual representation illustrates the notable tech mergers and acquisitions finalized in 2020, providing concise details such as the acquired company, acquiring company, deal amount, and deal date. I think this chart is inventive and visually engaging. I like the way that they were able to explain how to read the graph directly on the graph itself. Seems to give it more character. I also like the insights imbedded into the graph like that nvidia had the most expensive deals made by aquiring two companies. One part which I dont know if I like is the overlapping. This is noticeble with the first two bubbles on the graph. It would be tough to shift the top of the datapoints because then it might mess with the way its viewed on the timeline so I dont have a great solution to this off the top of my head.
