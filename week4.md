Visualization: https://flowingdata.com/2015/12/15/a-day-in-the-life-of-americans/ 

This graph displays a simulation of 1,000 people’s average day. It’s based on 2014 data from the American Time Use Survey. Each dot represents a person, 
the color represents the activity, and time of day is shown in the top left. As someone changes an activity, say from sleep to a morning commute, the dot 
moves accordingly. I particularly enjoyed the aesthetics and animations of this graph as seeing the dots that represent individuals move from task to 
task during their day was visually appealing. The graph also gives useful descriptions about the overall activities that are going on during different 
times as well as the percentage of people participating in each activity, which I think is very helpful for the viewer when looking at the graph in 
fast mode. Although the graph was visually appealing, it seemed to sacrifice the statistics for an individual's daily schedule for a visual that 
focuses on a more granular sense of how each person contributes to the overall patterns. Because of this, it's difficult to track a specific person's 
daily routine in the graph. Also, it appears that some dots get stuck in clusters when trying to move from task to task, making it slightly more 
difficult in understanding the visualization. One thing I would like to add to this graph is the ability to choose which people can be displayed 
on the graph, allowing for a better understanding of the daily patterns of activities for things like men between the ages of 20-30, or for people 
who are married. Overall, I would say that the graph is a unique and effective way to present a more granular sense of the overall daily activities 
of people and trending patterns.
