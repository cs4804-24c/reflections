This visualization shows the timeline of major pandemics alongside their death toll. The way the timeline is depicted, top to bottom, is interesting, allowing them to depict a large stretch of time without needing to wrap around. This not wide but long orientation makes the graphic more suited to its location on website, which is again further supported by the way it goes top to bottom, the same way we scroll. The foreshortening of the outbreaks could have been an issue with regards to size comparison, but this is handled quite well by the inclusion of a side-by-side size comparison area at the bottom. The texture and color of the spheres adds to their visual interest without being too much or taking anything away. That being said, I am not completely convinced that the size of the spheres completely aligns with the related death toll numbers (we have an r cubed relationship for volume), but even if it was wrong the current graphic wouldn't lose anything. The font used feels appropriate and the additional details are interesting and without being too much. Something worth considering is that the visualization is difficult to take in at a single glance. The length is just a bit long, needing a reasonably long scan to traverse the visualization's length. In addition the text of the titles and death tolls is a little to small to parse on a quick scan through the the whole zoomed out image. The visualization isn't designed to be taken in at a glance due to its location on a website, but if it were to be transferred to a poster format this readability issue would come into play. That being said it wouldn't be too hard to fix, again just increase the font size of the pandemic name, death toll, and time period.
