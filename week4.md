This is a visualization of USA population, split into hexagons that represent 100,000 people. It also outlines Metropolitan Statistical Areas, which helps to show just how much of the population lives in a state. The arrangement of hexagons also emulates the actual shape of each state, which helps make the visual instantly click. While everything could be connected, I think it helps to show how small the mid-west is. Additionally, little details like lines to names that were further away from the actual location make the visualization pretty easy to read despite the amount of detail. Additionally, the author has made a difference between this and another line that connects metro areas that are across multiple states. Depending on what the intent of the use is, I think there are a few edits to be made. For example, if it was to see how much of the population metropolitan areas take up, it would be important to only highlight those areas. Additionally, the colors could confuse someone who is involved in US politics. When reddish colors and blueish colors are used in a map, it typically means Republican and Democrat.
