For this week's visualization, I chose a post on r/dataisbeautiful showcasing numbers sorted alphabetically from 0-99 in various languages.

I find this visual interesting for several reasons. First of all, they normalize the length of the alphabets and sort by relative position in the alphabet instead of by letter, allowing the graphs to all use a standard scale.
The graph also uses square markers, which is hard to notice at a smaller scale, but zoomed in, makes it easier to align the numbers with their point on the graph.
The dataset itself is interesting, especially with how German ends up being so clearly distinct. This is just because German says the ones digit before the tens (1 and 20 instead of 21), but creating such a different graph from what is otherwise a small change is interesting.

However, I think that the choice of languages could be better. Having two of English/French/Spanish is fine to show how similar they are, but it would have been much more compelling to see another language with a unique counting order, such as Latin numerals or Danish.
Alternatively, including non-romance languages would also be interesting, since they would likely follow a similar pattern to the languages shown, but with the clusters forming at different positions in the alphabet.
Finally. it would also be good to have a combined scatter plot to make it easier to compare the languages directly, and to show how many of the numbers in English/French/Spanish are clustered at around the same spot.
