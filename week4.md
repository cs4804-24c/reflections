  I like this because it shows so much info in such a readable graphic. I think a useful statistic would be including some version of tips per hour or hours total etc. However I do appreciate the cash vs credit because I think that shows valuable information about how people (in this area) tip these days. It is very easy to see that credit is much more popular than cash. I also appreciate the red for the "worst" or lower than average statistics. This way the values are highlighted and red often equates to "bad". To repeat this in a larger scope could provide very useful insights. Another useful statistic would be about including how often there was no tip provided. Then there could be a greater comparison of the overall experience of the server's tips received. This was made with a function new to me called piktograph and I will be looking into this for the future.
