Reflection: 
This week I found a website discussing a debate on Airbnbs. The debate is whether Airbnbs are disrupting the hotel 
industry or not. The site is trying to argue that they do not actually disrupt the hotel industry, but rather disrupt
housing and communities. In order to back up this claim, the site has provided Airbnb data from a few major cities 
around the world. To analyze the data visualizations I have decided to focus on the visualizations for New York City. 
The first thing I noticed was that all the dots on the map were red and green, which immediately makes the data 
not accessible for those who are red-green colorblind. I do however like how they are breaking up each of the types of 
Airbnbs by color. I think differentiating between the types really helps them make their point. I do think on the side 
of the image where they are breaking up the data by category that they are being misleading with data. They try to put
a big emphasis on how 53% of Airbnbs are entire homes/apartments, but about half are also private rooms, so this is not
actually that convincing of a data point if you think about it. Another piece of data I liked was the graph depicting 
how many listings each airbnb owner has. I think this graph helps their argument a lot because it emphasises how people
are using Airbnb as a primary income source instead of as a way to rent out extra space. I also really like the popovers
that appear when you hover over each of the individual data points. I think it makes the visual more interesting to 
interact with. I do however wish that you could click on some of teh information within the popover to expand it and 
learn more about each of the things listed within the popover. I found myself trying to click on the popovers multiple 
times and would have enjoyed because able to learn more about the reviews left on the Airbnb or more details about the 
owner of that specific Airbnb.
