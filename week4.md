This week I looked at this visualization by visual capitalist on Americas $20 Trillion Economy by state. I think this is an amazing visualization and is super easy to understand as a viewer.
The visualization opened my eyes to how big Americas economy is. For example I didnt California had a $2.9 trillion GDP and would be a top 10 biggest GDP worldwide if it was its own country.
I love this visualization because it not only shows each states contribution in America but also has divisions by region which contribute to the economy. And it comes to no surprise that New york area
is generating over $2 trillion in economic output. The tables along with the visualization of the data make this a website I loved visiting.
