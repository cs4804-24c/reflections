The visualization I chose this week is a tree map (or pair of tree maps rather) that show information on people that make over $100,000 dollars a year. The first
graph shows their bachelor's degrees, and the second graph depicts their current jobs. I thought that this was a very tidy way to present all of this information, and 
it seems very organized at first sight. I also enjoyed the color scheme, which contained various shades of green (where the darkness of the shade represents a higher number of people
in that category, I think), and black outlines. The color scheme made the visualization non-distracting, so I could focus on different pieces of information without
being drawn to another area of the graph. I think that this visualization would benefit from having some sort of legend next to it, so I could be able to tell what
the shades of the color mean on what sort of scale. Also, the biggest portions of the second tree map say "all other jobs". While I appreciate that there are probably 
a very large number of jobs that didn't fit into the other categories on the map, I might have appreciated a little insight into exactly what these "other" jobs are. I think
that overall this visualization does a clean and succinct job of presenting the intended data, but I am left wondering a little more than I should be. Some additional information
or visual aids showing additional aspects of the data could be very beneficial. Also, some of the text for the smaller sections inside the map is unreadable without zooming
in, so I think the use of tooltips might be more helpful in this case than having tiny text.
