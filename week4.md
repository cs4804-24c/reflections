This visualization, titled "Adults across the US are reporting higher rates of mental unwellness," is a line graph that effectively presents a decade's worth of data (2011-2021) on the increase in reported mental unwellness among adults in the US. The use of thin lines to represent individual states or territories and thicker lines for the overall US average provides both micro and macro perspectives, which is commendable. The color-coded distinction between women (in pink) and men (in blue) aids in quick visual interpretation. However, the overlapping thin lines can make the data appear more complex and harder to dissect at a glance. A cleaner presentation or interactive feature allowing viewers to isolate specific data sets might enhance readability. Despite being outdated, this graph remains significant as it underscores a concerning upward trend in mental unwellness reports, an issue that has likely been exacerbated by recent global events like the COVID-19 pandemic. It serves as a reminder of the ongoing need for accessible mental health resources and societal support systems. The style is aesthetically pleasing but could benefit from clearer demarcation between years for easier tracking of trends over time. Additionally, providing context or potential correlations with major events or policy changes could offer viewers deeper insights into the factors influencing these trends. The small text at the bottom indicating the source and creation tool ("Source: CDC; Created with Datawrapper") adds credibility to the data presented. However, it could be made more prominent to ensure viewers can easily verify the information. Overall, this visualization is a powerful tool for raising awareness about mental health issues, despite its minor shortcomings.
