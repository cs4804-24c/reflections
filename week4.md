This is an animated unit visualization based on the data from American Time Use Survey and shows what people are doing at different times of the day. The subject of this visualization is how a day in the life of Americans is. The important and crucial variable in this visualization is time. As time changes, the number of dots representing each activity changes accordingly. In this visualization, each dot represents a person, different colors represent different activities and the time of day is shown in the top left. The dots move accordingly as someone changes an activity. This is a simulation of 1000 people’s average day that starts at 4 AM and runs through 24 hours. With the use of this visualization, we are able to predict people’s activities at different times of the day. For keeping track of where people went, lines were drawn to show the paths. Based on some of the observed patterns, most people wake up between 6:30 and 7:30 and head to work. From 12 PM to 1 PM, there is a movement from work to eating and then back again. When it is 5 PM, people head home from work. And at like 10 PM, people eventually go to sleep.
