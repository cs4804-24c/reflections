I really like the color of this graph. The infographic's color scheme effectively delineates various sections, aiding in clarity and organization. Each segment pertaining to different aspects of Vitamin D, such as sources, benefits, and deficiency symptoms, is distinctly monochrome color-coded. This simple visual hierarchy enables viewers to navigate the information effortlessly, fostering comprehension and retention. A monochrome color palette ensures visual cohesion throughout the infographic. By maintaining a cohesive visual identity, the infographic cultivates a sense of professionalism and reliability, engendering trust in the conveyed information. The Daily intake part is a very clever way to show the contrast between different sources, using circle and ring size. The Covid section seems a bit excessive, as it provides uncertain information.
