TheyRule is a demonstration of how wealth is concentrated. This is the most fun, interactive visualization that I've come across. It's, at heart, just a graph of connected nodes. Clicking on a person expands a list of companies of which they're on the board of executives. Clicking a company expands a list of people on the board. Quickly, the reader realizes how interconnected these people and companies are.

I particularly like the simple, monochromatic style of this visualization. The graph comes of as humble and ominousâ€” like a newspaper article. I also like how satifying it is to drag nodes around and watch them pull on each other.
