For this week I chose Joseph Priestly's ‘Chart of History’ for this weeks visualization. While it most certainly isn’t the most up-to-date and futuristic graphic, The Chart of History  featured a horizontal timeline that depicted historical individuals and events. Notable people were represented by labeled lines, and important events were highlighted at appropriate intervals on the timeline. The chart's sections each represented a different historical era, from prehistoric times to Priestley's own.

Priestley's chart, which predates modern timelines and infographics, was an innovative attempt at historical visualization. Its goal was to simplify and visually communicate challenging historical themes in order to make history more approachable and interesting to learn.

I think this visualization demonstrates the humble beginnings of visualization, and emphasizes how some methods of displaying data remain similar to almost 300 years ago.
