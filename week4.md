Text message scams has been on the rise with the emergence of new technologies. In 2022, text message fraud has cost Americans  a median loss of $1,000 per incident, compared to the overall consumer fraud median loss of $650. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) reported that Americans collectively lost nearly $330 million to text message scams. Out of the 2.56 million fraud reported 22% was from text fraud. The graph showed that Georgia had the highest rate of fraud reports in 2022, with 1,611 reports per 100,000 people. While North Dakota had the lowest at 568 per 100,000 people. Fraud has caused Americans nearly $9 billion. Text message fraud incidents were mainly related to business impostors. Which was 31.8% of all reported cases, resulting in losses of $35.1 million. Followed by investment scams, led to the most significant losses, totaling $149.53 million. In the past phone calls were the most common type of fraud report.
