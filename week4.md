This week I thought it would be fun to explore the ways data is conveyed in real time as a tool in industry. 

This is just one of many software apps that will show you a spectrum analyzer of soundways. It changes in real time as you feed it data and displays a fast fourier Transform to show how the sound occupys space in the sound spectrum. To simplify, if you think of all complex sound waves as a combination of different sine waves (which it literally is) then looking at those sine waves broken up can help you gain helpful insights on the sound you're analizing. I use this tool most days in my music and sound engineering life to do many things, but it is in of itself a way of visualizing data.
