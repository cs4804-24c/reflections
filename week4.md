For this week's reflection, I tried to really think about where I see visualizations in my daily life. I realized that when scrolling through
TikTok, I frequently see animated visualizations about the top music artists over the years. The visualization I chose, titled "Spotify Monthly 
Listeners Battle: Top Superstar Artists (2019-2022)," displays a colorful and animated horizontal bar chart of the top 10 artists for each day
between 2019 and 2022. Though the quick moving bars can be a bit difficult to read, I think the fast-paced music and progression of the timeline
are perfect for a platform like TikTok where each video is trying to hold the viewer's attention. When looking for this graph, I stumbled upon
multiple other videos that were 5 minutes or more. While these may be easier to understand, I find it very unlikely that these long videos
are able to hold the attention of TikTok viewers who are generally most interested in the entertainment value of the videos they watch. I think the
creators of this graph did a great job of making it fun and engaging. Despite the number of different artists, the color of each bar is
different enough for the average person to notice the difference. The artist names on the left coupled with the picture of the artist in the bar
also makes it clear which artist corresponds to which bar. The visualization also makes the date of each data point very clear. In addition to
the bolded date in the bottom right continuously changing, there is a timeline at the bottom of the screen with a small triangle that moves
along as the visualization progresses. Although may viewers may not focus on this, it was also nice for the actual number of listeners to
be displayed on the right side of the bar for viewers who are interested in understanding the actual data. 

This visualization is a great example of a way to present a large amount of dynamic data very quickly. On Spotify, the top 10 artists change
on a daily basis, making it impossible to create a static visualization without adding filters or some other interactivity. This visualization
allows viewers to sit back and notice some of the key trends in the data such as "Ed Sheeran, Ariana Grande, Justin Beiber, and The Weeknd"
have been pretty consistenly popular artists between 2019 and 2022. This visualization can also be engaging for readers as they scan the
visualization for their favorite artists. For example, I am a fan of Olivia Rodrigo, so it was exciting for me to see her name pop up in
2021, right around the time that here SOUR album was released. Whoever posted this video did their best to capitalize on this by captioning
the video "watch and cheer for your favorite."

My recommendation for improving this visualization would be to put the name of the artist on the bar. Given the fast pace of this visual,
I think that this would slightly improve the readability, as the user would not have to move their eyes to the left when looking for the
names and could instead focus on the movement of the bars. The creators could also create some different versions of this visualization
and see how the audience reacts. Some changes could be going month by month instead of day by day to slow down the visualization or keeping
the same speed, doing months, and increasing the timeline (2000-2020 for example). A good thing about posting visualizations on TikTok and
similar platforms is that you can post multiple versions, and generally those that viewers like best will be boosted and shown to more viewers.

Although this video is far less popular than similar ones with hundreds of thousands of views, the comments still bring up a good point:
How trustworthy is the data that we see on social media apps like TikTok? Some comments on this video include "Spotify literally gift
bad bunny 3 rings (2020,2021,2022) for being the most listened on each year," "badbunny??," and other similar comments questioning the accuracy
of the visualization. After searching through the Spotify website, I too noticed that in 2020, Bad Bunny was the top artist globally
and had the most streamed album globally. This makes me wonder if either the data is inaccurate, or if this visualization is focussed
on a specific subset of the data that is not specified properly. This is a bit concerning considering how many consumers of social
media are quick to trust what they see without looking deeply into sources and such. This brings up the issue of how a visualization
can be misleading, even if this is not done on purpose. 

**A Grammer of Graphics:**

**Data:** Spotify data on the number of streams per artist

**Aesthetics:** Labels on each bar (for artist and number of streams), title, timeline, continuous x-position, categorical y-position, random colors for each category, picture of artist on each bar

**Scale:** X: No specific axis labels (could be 0->max number of streams), Y: Many different artists (no specific label, 1 bar per artist)

**Geometric Objects:** Bars

**Statistics:** Raw data of artist and streams, raw time data

**Facets:** Full data in one chart
