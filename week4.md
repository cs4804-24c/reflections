This visualization contains multiple graphs for visualizing the available dating pool for everyone. I found this particularly interesting because everyone can relate to it, and on top of that, towards the bottom of the article, it has a multiple graphs/options you can interact with and visualize the changes. The graphs are simple, plotting people available to date to age; it also identifies peaks in the dating pool. While this gives an interesting idea of what's available out there, it does bring many different factors and constraints out of context, as it really just reduces down the variables to just age vs people available without considering anything else, but what can you do about it when you're trying to make something look good/simple.

Aside from the semantics of the visualizations, I really like the way the data is presented (or more so the UX), as when the article is transitioning between attributes such as male vs female, it smoothly transitions the plot and you can see where the pool dips at which age, as well as the opposite. It allows you to confirm/deny any assumptions you might have had before reading the article/viewing the graphs. The options they give you, such as employment and race, all give it a great touch for the general looks of the visualizations. One thing I would add, though, is more options that give more context, such as location/geography, country, etc. I think those would make this more informative and even more interesting to inspect.
