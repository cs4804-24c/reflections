The integration of various data sets into a cohesive visual narrative using different colors for each health issue and different marker sizes to emphasize frequency is well done. Health Infoscape effectively combines complex health-related data into visually engaging representations that are accessible and understandable to a broad audience. Its ability to convey detailed information about different health indicators and trends in a straightforward manner makes it more accessible and engaging to users. 

The interactive features of Health Infoscape enhance user engagement and exploration. Users can interact with the visualizations by zooming, filtering, or toggling between different data views, allowing for customization of the experience and deeper exploration of areas of interest. Also the aesthetic design of Health Infoscape is worth noting, as the visualizations are appealing and thoughtfully crafted, incorporating color, typography, and layout to effectively communicate information. The use of visual elements such as charts, graphs, and maps is well-balanced and contributes to the overall clarity and coherence of the presentation.

One downside however is that Adobe Flash Player is required to make this visualization interactive, and because Adobe Flash Player is no longer supported, I myself was unable to change settings on the visualization.
