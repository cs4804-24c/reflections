This map of literacy rates in France from 1826 is the first example of a Choropleth map by Baron Pierre Charles Dublin.
It shows this data by superimposing using different levels of brightness on areas of France. As with all Choropleth maps that followed it, the darker areas of the map represent areas with the 
greatest literacy. The difference is very striking thanks to differences in shade being some of the most noticiable changes on a graph. Additionally, based on the map, if you know that the
darker areas are darker it is easy to find areas with the most and least literacy in the country. Admittedly, I would not know what the shade of the map meant without the Wikipedia article,
however since I can't speak or read French and the graph is cropped from a picture of the paper it was in I may be missing something. This method of using only shades of black may seem bland
when compared to our modern multi-colored graphs, but at the time printing presses did not use colored images due to the complexity, in fact the first Newspaper to start printing in color was
the New York Times in the 1990s. With the tools available to him at the time and the simple fact that it was the first graph of its kind, this graph holds up suprisingly well nearly 200 years later.
