To illustrate changes in common household types in the U.S. this article uses an alluvial diagram. It's a combination of a flowchart and stacked area chart. The graph shows how we went from it being more common to be a married household with kids in the 1970s to living alone or married with no children in 2020. Overtime, Americans have waited longer to get married and have fewer to no kids. The visualization dooes a very good job at showing the changes over time. It does get harder to follow what each color means, specially as some sections get smaller and smaller. At first glance, I didn't even notice the single father at the bottom of the graph. I think a simpler way to showcase this data would be through a line graph. The colors used by the visualization are generally good, with an exception of the two yellows. The yellow that signifies married couple with children and the yellow that signifies a single mother are too similar that it gets slightly confusing.
