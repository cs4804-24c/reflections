Week 4 Reflection Patrick Salisbury

This interactive visualization shows a map of the Earth along with various statistics about the world's forests from 2000 to the present day.
On the map, green represents forested area, which (I believe) was collected using satellites designed to specifically detect the color of foliage growth. 
Pink areas represent a net loss of forests, where blue represent a net increase of forest cover. 
Using the timescale, one can interactively show where forest cover has increased and decreased over the last two decades in a very high resolution.
It is important to note that loss of forest is not necessarily deforestation here; the map takes forest loss for any reason into account, including wildfires and other incidents.
Some areas of the globe that really showed strong effects of deforestation were places like the Brazilian rainforest (deforestation) and areas like Siberia and northern Canada (wildfire-prone areas).
I really like this map overall, but there are still a few ways to make it better.
Firstly, I would like to see a way to change the colors for each layer, since I personally am not colorblind and I still have trouble differentiating between the blue and pink when the map is zoomed out relatively far. For people with color blindness this could be even more useful.
I also looked into the analysis tools, but having a guide to get started with these more easily would be a lot better (the question mark in the bottom right does not really give much of a tutorial regarding using the analysis tools).
Finally, there are a few satellite imagery layers, but I think that incorporating some more in would allow for further functionality of the data. These existing layers were also really slow which made for a slightly annoying user experience.
