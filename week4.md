World's Biggest Data Breaches & Hacks

Reflection:

David McCandless and Tom Evans created a nice visualization about data breaches and hacks from 2004 to 2023.
There are two visualizations here, one is a timeline and the other is grouped by specific sensitivities.
In both charts, the size of the bubble represent how much data was lost.
What I like most about this visualization is that it is interactive.
If you hover over a bubble, it gives you more information about the data breach and you can also click on it to pull up where the source of the information came from.
A big positive is that I can filter by specific sector and methods which makes the timeline less cluttered.
That was a major complaint I had in most other visualizations, was the lack of a filtering option.
If I had to change stuff in this chart, I would update the color scheme.
I think it would be beneficial to have a color gradient based off of the size of the bubbles as well to allow more readability.
Currently as it stands, the color scheme is just grey, yellow, and blue.
And without a legend, I don't even know what the colors represent.
From what I can tell it seems pretty random.
