For this weeks reflection I chose a visualization from the dataisbeautiful Reddit page titled 
[_Which NFL teams overachieve and underachieve in the playoffs since 2000? (actual vs projected playoff wins; NFL, American football)_](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/19alcuj/oc_which_nfl_teams_overachieve_and_underachieve/)

This visualization is a scatter plot of NFL teams' regular season wins vs their playoff wins since 2000. This also has a line of best fit on the plot, showing the expected playoff wins for a given number of regular season wins. 
While this is a simple chart, it easily shows the goal of the visualization. Users interacting with this visualization can easily spot New England being far ahead of the expectation for their wins, and all the teams below the 
line of best-fit underperforming in their playoff games. I feel that this visualization is somewhat cluttered as it has a lot of text throughout, such as with the arrow for the New England Patriots. I also think color could've 
been useful in this situation, as it could be used to represent the number of Super Bowl wins for each team. I would also like to see this statistic on a player basis instead of a team as well, since players (such as Tom Brady) 
have been on more than one team for their career. It could be useful to show who had the most impact throughout their Football career, and when teams became much worse off when some players retired or moved to a different team. 
It would also be interesting to see regular season points per game vs play-off points per game, showing if defense or offense was more important to get a victory when it mattered most. Overall, this visualization has a 
lot of potential and would benefit from interactability and more data to visualize for similar results.
