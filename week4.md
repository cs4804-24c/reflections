<h1>Week 4 Reflection</h1>
<p>Google Arts and Culture published a <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/story/artistic-experiments-exploring-climate-data/dAURnqK6udbDWA?hl=en">collection of online visualizations</a> that use climate data to explore different climate issues like rising sea levels, acidifying oceans and more. All of the visualizations in this series are quite beautiful and I definitely suggest looking at all of them if you have the time, but one that caught my eye was an <a href="https://artsexperiments.withgoogle.com/timelines#/glacier/triftglacier">interactive visualization</a> created by experimental photographer Fabien Oefner that shows the substantial and worrying melting of 2 glaciers in Switzerland over the last 140 years. In this visualization, users can explore an interactive glacier timeline. Users can mouse over a picture of a glacier and see beautiful lines that identify the boundaries of the glacier at certain time periods. The lines are bold and eye-catching and do a great job of showing how truly devastating and alarming the melting of the glaciers is. The visualization also does a wonderful job of data storytelling when you click the "discover" button at the bottom right. Through the discover page, you can read through the history of the glacier and how they used glacier data to create the visualization. Overall, the visualization is educational, provoking and beautiful. </p>
