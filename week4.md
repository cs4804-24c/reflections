This data shows Japan's daily earthquakes from 2011-2021. This data was interesting to me as it plotted every earthquake in Japan, and plotted the size based on the magnitude of the earthquake. The graph is unique in its way of presenting this information. It is sort of like a scatter plot, but instead of plotting it on the x and y, it is plotted around a circle, like polar coordinates. At 0 degrees its the month of January, 90 degrees is April, 180 degrees is June, and 270 degrees is October. In addition, I believe the colors were really well thought out, standing out from each other. From the data we can see some of the notable earthquakes in Japan including the largest, 2011 T≈çhoku earthquake and tsunami. 

While the graph is done really well, I believe that adding a legend would enhance the readability of the graph. The country of Japan in the middle of the circle is a great touch and ties everything together. As a reader, I can immediately understand or get a general idea of what the graph is about just based on the map of Japan in the middle. Also, adding some labels to some of the bigger and more notable earthquakes and where it is on the graph would also be really beneficial. It would help give a timeline, and creates story about some of the notable recent earthquakes in Japan. Overall, I think this graph is great and visually appealing. Along with that, it presents a unique way to make a scatterplot.
