For this week I wanted to find a visualiztation on air polution. my search fisrt started by looking to see if there were any 3d visualizations
of air polution statistics like I saw in the week one reflection about climate. Unfourtantley there didn't seem to be much which was unfourtanate
because I feel like that would of been a cool visualization. I ended up settiling for a 2d visualization and found this article from the new
york times https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/12/02/climate/air-pollution-compare-ar-ul.html. I think this is a good example of the amount
of interactivity an article like this should have. It quickly grabs your attention and invites the user to explore the article more. By scrolling
down the user can see how the air quality changes while being forced to look further into the article through this engaging method. The way this
visualization is set up it makes article more inviting and interative for the user as they progress through the article. Overall, I belive this is
a nice example of how to use a visualization to increase engagement of your users and make them more likely to read your work. The entire article
is good but the intial visualization make you want to read more.
