  This visualization, titled "Adults across the US are reporting higher rates of mental unwellness," is a line graph that effectively presents a decade's worth of data (2011-2021) on the increase in reported mental unwellness among adults in the US. I chose this visualization, because today is my 22nd birthday, and I have unfortunately had to deal with a loss due to mental health exactly a decade ago today. The significance for me and for the world today behind this visualization is to bring to light the seemingly never-ending mental health crisis. I think this visualization is difficult to read; the use of thin lines to represent individual states or territories and thicker lines for the overall US average provides both micro and macro perspectives, which is commendable but needs around ten seconds to understand. The color-coded distinction between women (in pink) and men (in blue) aids in quick visual interpretation. However, the overlapping thin lines can make the data appear more complex and harder to dissect at a glance. 
  An interactive feature allowing viewers to isolate specific data sets might enhance readability, however, and better explain how adults' mental health is on a global decline. Despite being outdated, this graph remains significant as it underscores a concerning upward trend in mental unwellness reports, an issue likely exacerbated by recent global events like the COVID-19 pandemic, however, it is unclear what sample size this dataset is covering. It serves as a reminder of the ongoing need for accessible mental health resources and societal support systems. The style is aesthetically pleasing but could benefit from a better axis heading description or a distinct legend describing line elevation and trend. The small text at the bottom indicating the source and creation tool ("Source: CDC; Created with Datawrapper") adds credibility to the data presented. However, it could be made more prominent to ensure viewers can easily verify the information. This visualization is a powerful tool for raising awareness about mental health issues, despite its minor shortcomings. I look forward to reevaluating this visualization in class as it may be created in a similar manner to our recent A2, the subject is important to me, and I believe this visualization is within my skill capacity, and I would make lines bolder or touch up the aesthetics of the Y axis.
