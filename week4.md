Visualization Reflection:

In this data visualization article, author and DataWrapper developer Antonio Sarcevic discusses a multi-line data visualization titled "My decade in Chillwave, Electro House, and R&B" that he created that tracks the top 30 music genres that he listened to between 2011 and 2023. This multiline chart is very intriguing due to a number of interesting design and technical features and axes choices. First, while the x-axis expectedly displays a tick for each year between 2011 and 2023, the y-axis measure is unusual for a line chart but very fitting for the data that Sarcevic is visualizing; each y-axis tick shows a finishing place (1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc..) to denote how frequently he listened to a music genre in a certain year. Since Sarcevic's data collection process involved keeping track of his most listened music genres, it makes sense that the y-axis would simply include finishing places. In addition to the interesting y-axis choice that I agree with, there is an interactive tooltip for each of the 30 lines (music genres) that show information including the music genre that correponds to the selected line and the finishing place for the matching year. Since there are only y-axis tick marks for certain finishing places, the access to a tooltip for each line is a beneficial feature as it gives the user finishing place information that is not otherwise fully clear just based on looking at the y-axis. Adjacent to the textual information tooltips provide, Sarcevic's visualization also includes static labels connecting to certain years on some of the colored lines. Sarcevic included these labels for some of the colored lines to provide the user with contextual information surorunding his corresponding music listening. For example, for the blue line corresponding to Hip-Hop, Sarcevic included a label with the information "I discover Kanye West's 2010 album 'My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy,'" which gives the user context for the subsequent increase in his Hip-Hop listening frequency in the years following 2014. One last aspect of the visualization that I agree with is Sarcevic's choice to only emphasize through color a small number of music genres that he listened to the most between 2011 and 2023; this design choice is crucial as it ensures that the data visualization is not cluttered with distinct line colors for each of the 30 music genres. Overall, this is a fantastic music data visualization, and for further improvement, placing the contextual label information inside of a larger tooltip for each line would allow the visualization to appear aesthetically simpler and easier to the eye up front.
