  I like this because it shows so much info in such a readable graphic. I think a useful statistic would be including some version of tips per hour or hours total etc. However I do appreciate the cash vs credit because I think that shows valuable information about how people (in this area) tip these days. It is very easy to see that credit is much more popular than cash. To repeat this in a larger scope could provide very useful insights. Another useful statistic would be about including how often there was no tip provided. Then there could be a greater comparison of the overall experience of the server's tips received.
