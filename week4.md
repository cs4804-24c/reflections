For this week's reflection I looked at a visualization of Appleâ€™s Q1 FY24 Income Statement. The first thing that stood out to me was the use of colors. The use of the gray on the left and the color on the right to make the distinction between the revenue and what the revenue went in to makes it easier to understand. Also, the red and the green on the right to show profit and expenses. I think this is a really good application for this style of chart. It does a really good job of showing where different amounts of revenues come from and also how exactly they get spent while being able to actually see it. And of course the inclusion of the actual dollar amounts removes any uncertainty. The only thing I did not like about the visualization was the number % Y/Y underneath each value. I feel like there is no context for this and maybe a label at the bottom explaining exactly what this meant would have been helpful. However, this is very minor as I am sure the viewers that will want this information will understand what it means.
