I found this collection of visualizations on Reddit, and I was immediately drawn into it so I knew I wanted to talk about it. First of all it's just a very impressive and clean way to express information. I appreciate how there's several semi-overlapping visualizations that together become more than the sum of their parts. I look forward to seeing more posts like these, especially since the comments are full of suggestions for more data to add, such as tip stats related to the bill.
To get more in-depth about what I notice in this visualization specifically, I really liked the consistent and intuitive use of color (cash is green), as well as the general layout of bubbles over background. I also enjoyed the highlights that were added in, like the best and worst months and days. That data is obviously present in the graphs themselves, but pulling it out and emphasizing it like that makes a difference. Showing things to people without making them look is very powerful. I'm left with questions like "why was tipping so bad in July?" and "why are there so many more cash tips on Valentine's Day than Mother's Day?".
There is definitely a lot of information missing, though, which was clarified in the comments. Stuff like shift length, weekly wage, etc. All very useful details which help put the data into perspective.
Going off of that, especially with those clarifications there was a lot of discussion about the difference between tip vs non-tip income, minimum wage, and tipping culture in general. This is what kept me engaged for the longest with this post. People got all outraged about how unfair it is to make that much money for low-skill work. Others pointed out how most servers they know don't pay taxes on their cash tips. Minimum wage, food prices, and greedy owners all came up in what became a pretty heated debate in some comments. 
I think it says a lot, the discussion that can come from a handful of charts about one person's life. The community's response to this post seems to indicate that a lot of people are drawn in to this kind of discussion, possibly to rant or to share their beliefs or propose a solution. People love to complain, and they love to share uninformed opinions about topics they're passionate about. In this, way, data visualization can be used as a tool to influence how people behave and think. It's not always about the numbers on the screen, it's about how they make people feel and what comes about as a result of those feelings. I wonder how many people moved on from this post with a changed opinion about tipping.
