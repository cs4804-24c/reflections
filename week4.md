This article is about bad examples of data visualization, specificly chart junk. Chart junk is apects of data
visualizations that dont add anything helpful, or distract from the point the graph is trying to make. The 
example 6c shows a graph that I didnt think was too bad at first, assied fom the similar shading shading between
bars, but it is critiqued by the article mentioning that legend is not useful, and make reading the grpah
more of a chore than it should be. I found figure 6e interesting becuase it doesnt look pleasing, and the attempt
to make the chart more appealing makes it look silly, and could be confusing if the useless design elements are 
mistook for features represseinting data. There is also a heat map(figure 6h) where the colors represent 
quantities in a two dimensional scale as opposed to a 1d scale. While the graph isnt too hard to read, it is still much less
intuitive than graph with a heat map the represent a linear sclae. The last image is described by Edward Tufte as 
one of the worst data visualizations ever. The website cuts the image off halfway, but it can be found by looking
up "age structure in college enrollment Edward Tufte". This graph has a 3d design for no reason, and is difficult to read.
Also, the colors have no meaning on the graph. There are many better ways to represent the data, like a simple chart
for example.
