This article essentially continues to elucidate that data visualization is the key point of business value for these events. Outright saying that acumen in data 
visualization has gone from something that was once "nice to have" to something that is "required" points toward a mass-upskilling for career-focused employees.
The article also goes into detail about the types of data relevant in regards to business value with "conceptual" and "data-driven" data visualizations. Conceptual
