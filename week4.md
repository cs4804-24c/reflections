The Pudding is an online publication that is pretty well known for creating visually engaging articles. Those articles in particular are pretty heavily data-driven and usually contain multiple interactive elements to tell a story.
The specific article I chose for today is called "Same Name": https://pudding.cool/2023/03/same-name/. While this specific article is less so a story and more so an initial insight, it still contains numerous interactive elements.

Users can search up a city or town and based on their calculations, can see where exactly someone is referring to based on where they're from. One of their curated places is Pluto the dwarf planet; for pretty much everywhere in the US, people would refer to Pluto
as the planet, but apparently around the area west of Washinton D.C., people are more likely to refer to a county called Pluto in West Virginia. Upon googling the town, it's simply classified as an unincorporated community.

For another example, Boston surprisngly has numerous other areas on the East half of the US where it may actually refer to a different city, which is a bit surprising seeing.

Their formula for scoring each county on the map follows an interesting formula, particularly using a place's Wikipedia article length as a variable:

Unsure how I feel about a Wikipedia article being used in factoring the confidence score of a place.
