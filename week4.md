This visual was about the "Timeline: 150 Years of U.S National Debt". This visual was inspired the COVID-19 pandemic and how the national debt has chnaged over time when facing a crisis. This timeline was formualted by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) that provided some projections of potential trajectory of debt. The use of a disclaimer was good since debt is affected by many different factors and will need supplementary detail to have a more realistic estimation but given the circumstance there were able to create a sufficient visual. The choice of colors are consistent with the cultural implication of debt especially the color red. It groups based on major events in history like the WW1, WW2 and many more. There are some small facts about events that occurs which would have affected the GDP. Whereas the corresponding graph is my favorite since I can scoll across the line and see eveey detail though it does require a semi-steady hand but it show the complexity it goes into creating this parallel refernce when there are spikes and downfalls. One things that I found very interesting in the projection of the future was that 2050 would have 96M Social Security beneficiaries from the 65M in 2020, which made think there will be very difficult to regulate this. Utimately the GDP should be below 100 percent but 2020 was already 98.2 percent. To make even a bigger impact on the reader the is a chart to show off the the mahor impacters in affecting the GDP. Also there is more details discussing the specific statistics and what contributed the the influx of GDP.
