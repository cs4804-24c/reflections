An interesting visualization that I came across was from "What the 2018 Campaign Looks Like in Your Hometown" written by Demetrios Pogkas and David Ingold. Bloomberg News analyzed more than 3 million election ads for 2018 congressional and gubernatorial races. Of the data that they collected, I specifically chose to focus on the visual of “The Big Issues You’re Seeing on TV: Health Care, Taxes, and Jobs”, where the baseline is a map and have colors representing different parts of the states to showcase which issues were advertised more than others. The choice in color was a good choice since there is a stark difference between the colors to represent the different issues. Also the color choice makes it easy to show that there isn’t any hierarchy. Healthcare was the main driver during the 2018 campaign. The usage of a map makes it easier to understand how geographically issues are being presented and which are more important in different areas. This visual has blank spaces to account for places that were not measured, this aspect makes it seem that there isn't any bias in presenting the data and keeping it factual as possible so it does not become a tool to sway the reader’s attention.  However at the same time if there are some numbers to support the coloring it would make it easier to conceptualize how different issues compare with healthcare. If I did not read the article I would have not known how much data was used for this visual because it could have been 1,000 data points to 1,000,000 data points, there was no way to know unless the reader reads the article. Otherwise I believe this visual was a good representation of the data.
