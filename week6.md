Week 6
Visualization: https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2017/dec/20/bussed-out-america-moves-homeless-people-country-study?CMP=twt_gu 
This data visualization shows how the relocation of homeless people has affected America. This paper mostly focuses on the number of homeless people 
within San Francisco and how transporting the homeless people to other places has affected San Francisco. This paper also discusses individual 
experiences of homeless people and how relocation has affected them. The interviews of the experiences of the homeless people really helped the 
overall understanding of what the data was portraying and made the viewer more invested in the message the paper is trying to convey. One aspect 
I found helpful when viewing the paper was that when you viewed a graph, you would scroll through descriptions explaining what the graph displays 
and what the impact on America and homeless people is on the graph. This was helpful because it described what were the most important aspects of 
the data visualization and also how the graph was related to the paper itself. Throughout the paper, they used many animated graphs that showed 
the journey of homeless people. Another graph that used good interactive techniques was a flow like diagram graph showing Homeless Relocations 
from New York City. The graph was split into 3 separate parts that would add on to each other as you continue to observe the graph. First showing 
the most common foreign countries people were relocated to, then the most common place, then most common states in America. Overall, I liked the 
idea of using simple interactive graphs that were used to help when reading the paper and the descriptions over the graphs that you would scroll 
through to help understand the data.
