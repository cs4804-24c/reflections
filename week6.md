Week 6 Reflection

This visual is about selfies and analyzing the mechanics of it. It is from Selfiexploratory which is part of of Selficity. I like how the key features are formatted to shocase how a self will be analyzed by different models. By selecting the demographics, pose, features, and mood filters of the 3840 selfies makes it easier to understand what are common. I can see how this is the beginning for facial recgonition, though naive it still proves the point across. The choice of color sticks to the palette of the website. I think it would helpful to have tips or something indicate what each features means especially in the pose category. I like for the mood it is horizontal graph rather than faces, this makes it seem that there is a range when it comes to emotions. Whereas he question mark seems to hold a a specific purpose but it is not obvious as to what it is suppose to be. Locations are limited but for a trial purposes it does what it needs to. All the interactiveness could have been more focused rather have the selfies take up more than halp the webpage. Otherwise i thinks this is a very interesting concept to work with.
