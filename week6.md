The visualization I picked for this week was an infographic showing global water distribution to illustrate how scarce clean drinking water is. The first thing that I noticed was that it is basically a bunch of smaller charts with all of the arrows connecting to continually breakdown the distribution of water starting with all the water in the world and ending with the relatively small amount of water that is drinkable. Each time it's a very small percent of water that makes it to the next qualification of being drinkable. I like how this puts into scale how small that amount of drinkable water is by showing it incrementally. Also, I like that they use a different chart for each step instead of using the same one each time. I feel this helps to keep the focus of the viewer. However, I feel like that infographic is missing exact volumes of how much water makes it to each step. I appreciate the percentages that show comparatively how much water is drinkable but I feel actual volumes for how much water would have been helped get the message across. I also do not fully understand the use of meters cubed as the measurement for available water. Especially in the chart at the bottom of the infographic. I feel there needs to be more of an explanation of how that represents the total water.
