It is important to understand that thus far in class, we have been learning about data visualization techniques within the context of front-end development, making use
of various JavaScript frameworks like d3.js and CSS-styling. The article that I have provided goes into further detail, explaining data visualization as a technical 
intersection between user interface, information, data journalism, communication, and visual communication. The author even goes a step further and explicitly defines
data visualization as "the purpose [of data visualization] is to construct visualizations." I would also appreciate that while the article only delves into the prin-
ciples of data visualization within front-end development, the same principles also apply to back-end development.
