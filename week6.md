Reflection:
This week I found a map that visualizes different weather aspects. There are different tabs on the side to view 
different weather aspects in different parts of the world. I really like how interactive this website is and how easy it
is to navigate through the buttons on the side. I also really like the icons that they provided on the button to better 
convey to the reader what they are clicking on. For the temperature aspect of the map, I don't really like the shades 
they chose to represent the different temperatures. I feel like it is too rainbow and that there could have been better 
and less confusing color usage here. However, I do find the color usage on some of teh other tabs, such as "Air Quality"
and "Snow Cover" very impactful. I think the colors chosen here grab the attention of the user appropriately. I also 
really like the interactive timeline on the bottom. I like how you can navigate to different days and different times 
throughout the day to see what the weather conditions are like. Additionally, I really like the webcam feature. The 
webcam allows you to see live data from different places on the map. I think this is a very interesting feature for the 
user because it allows them to compare the data they are being presented with to the place in real time. Overall I think
this is a very advanced data visualization that is able to encapsulate all aspects of weather over time very effectively
in a way that is very engaging for the viewer.
