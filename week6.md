<h1>Week 6 Reflection</h1>
<p>In one of my classes we were shown this <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/ipqlth27lbiykbd/companies-disney-owns.jpg?e=1&dl=0">data visualization</a> about all the companies the Walt Disney Company owns. This visualization does a great job of visualizing the sheer amount of companies that the Walt Disney Company owns. Rather than viewing just a list of companies, viewers can see a map of every company they own and all the companies that branch out of those companies. They provide a useful color legend that identifies what industry their companies belong to along with a line width legend to identify parent companies versus subsidiary companies. This visualization was almost alarming and awing to see, it puts into perspective for viewers that the Walt Disney Company owns a lot of companies and a lot of companies in a variety of industry sectors. </p>
