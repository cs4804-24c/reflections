Summary: Google trends on searched for the word Palestine
Reflection: I use Google Trends searches for topics quite often in my various research since it provides a really good scope on what are the hot topics and how those reflect some of the ongoing events/trends. One thing that I appreciate about overall Google Trend visualizations is that it provides the same data in different levels of granularity which allows for relatively easy and quick analysis. I appreciate the trends graph and the labels that are provided as well as the interest by region in the US map. One interesting thing included is the related topic tab which often comes up with odd topics and thus I am not fully sure how useful it is. I also appreciate that all the data/visualizations can be downloaded. One thing that I would improve on is the color scheme to differentiate between the different levels of detail provided. For my own work, I can take away the simplicity of data representation and clear separation of various details on the data.
