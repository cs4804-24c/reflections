this article is about spiral plot/time series spiral. I chose to write about this visualization becuase it was of a type that
I have never seen before. My firse impressions are that it looks like a harder to read bar chart. comparing sgmants looked difficult at first.
Im not sure, and it is not very obvious in the graph, but I think you can compare the the sizes of the segmants using the base and portiojn of the spiral obve the ssegment. 
I dont think this is a very good tool for visualizing trends over time, becuase the segmants curing in a spiral does not help devolpe a sense of temporal trends in the
way that a bar chart with the same data might. Additionally, the length of segments grow as the they deviate from the center of the spiral. This makes it harder to 
guage differences between the segmants.
