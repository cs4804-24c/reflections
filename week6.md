This website uses multiple data visualizations which show Japan's ageing population. The first visualization is a line graph that animates when scrolling. The graph highlights how certian countries like China, Korea and Germany are following a similar trend in a ageing population. The next visualization are maps showing where populations are aging the quickest. It shows that rural location are aging the quickest. This is due to most younger individuals moving to cities in Japan. This graph is animated but I honestly don't think this is nessesary. It doesnt add anything to the visualization in my opinion. The next visualization is my favorite out of all of them. Its an animated bar chart that shows the projected populations age distribution for Japan in 2065. It keeps the 1965 data in the background as a reference which I feel like I dont see too often but thought was really interesting.
