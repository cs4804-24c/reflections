This visualization shows the paths members of the House of Reps. took to get to Congress. Colors are based on party lines, blue for Democrats and red for Republicans. What really makes this visualization shine is the way it plays into the article itself and its interactive aspect. The article includes certain buttons, such as "Hover to see members with no bachelor's degree" and "Law school", which filter the visualization. The article contextualizes this based on the general population vs house of reps, but you can also see how it is in the house of reps. Even the way the layout of the article is done, with the scroll being horizontal means the visualization is always very prominent. Additionally, you can hover on a line to have it highlighted. The representative filter will automatically update to have the corresponding representative. You can also sort by state. The use of the circle to point out standout moments really highlight major steps taken by alot of the house, and make the visual alot easier to understand.
