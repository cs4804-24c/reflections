This data shows the medium consumer broadband download speed of countries around the world throughout the years. The data is taken from 2012-2023, with countries including the U.S., China, Singapore, Chile, etc. The data is represented in a line graph with Speed (mbps) on the Y-axis and time (years) on the X-axis. At the far right of the graph, it also displayed the flag of the country and the speed of their internet. I thought that was a good addition to the graph as it provided some visuals. The graph is really simple, just using categorical data and colors to represent the different countries. I thought the graph was interesting as it shows the development of these countries over recent years, especially in the technology industry. The graph shows that all the countries are developing, with some faster than other. It also shows that countries like the U.S. have remained as one of the top developing countries. Additionally, countries like Singapore, China, and Chile had made massive strides in recent years.

Overall, I think this graph is really well done. It is simple, clean, and easy to read. For improvements, I would first move the legend to the right side, as I feel that it is really cluttered at the top. In addition, I think the colors can correspond to the countries a little better, like using the countries flag colors for example. Also the right side of the graph is a little cluttered with all the flags, so I would consider making it so it displays the flags when you hover over a country's line and not constantly be visible. Overall, this graph is done really well.
