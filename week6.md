Week 6 Reflection Patrick Salisbury

For this week's reflection, I chose to do an astronomy light pollution map, which is a tool I use on a regular basis when scouting out new spots to observe from.
On this map, light pollution is represented on a color scale ranging from dark gray (the darkest areas) to white (the brightest areas). Astronomers have actually invented their own scale, called the Bortle scale, to classify how bright or dark the sky in a particular location is.
One of the most important things to note here is that the change in the sky from one color to the next is actually very significant and is a lot more than people realize. Many people that think they have seen a truly dark sky have only seen the sky from a yellow or maybe a green zone. The sky can get much darker than that and most people never actually realize this.
The actual light pollution data is taken from satellite imagery of artifical lighting at night. I believe there is some type of function used to calculate the light pollution levels based on the artificial lighting brightness on a satellite image at a given point. 
On the left of the map, you can select different dates for the light pollution map. One of my pet peeves about this map is that the 2006 data is selected automatically, meaning that to see the latest data you have to open this layer window every time. 
Another cool feature of the map is the 2013-2022 trend layer, which when active shows just how much light pollution has increased across the globe in the last decade. Some really impressive areas are West Texas, where new natural gas wells have created huge light pollution in unpopulated areas, as well as pretty much the entire rest of the globe, where China and India really stand out as having huge increases in artifical light pollution.
