The article discusses how shrinking populations, especially the decline in working-age populations, can fuel divisive politics and have negative consequences for societies. The map illustrates changes in working-age populations worldwide by 2050. With a focus on regions like Europe, Brazil, China, Chile, Japan, and Russia experiencing a decline. The decline in working-age populations has been attributed to lower birthrates as countries become wealthier. Because of the decline birth rates there has been efforts to  boost fertility through various programs. However, some countries like Australia, Canada, and the United States show modest growth due to immigration.Immigration as a partial solution to demographic challenges causes political barriers to arise, particularly fueled by anti-immigrant sentiments. As depopulation occurs, the state tends to withdraw services from these regions, leading to difficulties and  neglect among residents. This leads to far right parties blaming immigrants for societal problems and creating a cycle where depopulation issues fuel divisive politics that hinder effective policy solutions. The article ends with an emphasis on a need for a shift in public debate, addressing the reality of depopulating regions and aging populations, urging policymakers to address these challenges sooner rather than later .
