This chart reminds me of the timeline pie chart that I reflected on in the first week. The article is focused on the fact that the spiral is slightly off-center: the focal point would be just barely to the right of the origin.

I'm more interested in spiral itself. I suggested in week 1 that the wildfire data may better be presented as some sort of clock. This is exactly what I wish I had come up with. It's elegant, readable, and concise. It's more compact and engaging than a line graph while also highlighting the trends that appear in certain months.

It's rather difficult to understand what the exact numbers are, but I don't think that's important. The graph is supposed to show local maximums and minimums: not overall numbers. Maybe we could do with a number pointing at the widest and thinnest parts on the spiral.
