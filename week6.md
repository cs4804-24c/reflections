For this week’s visualization I chose to focus on a visualization called “The median age of population radial graph” by the Visual Capitalist. This, instead of usual a bar chart, uses a radial approach to represent the data. In my opinion, for this particular dataset,  this is more visually impactful than a standard bar chart. The graph uses different colors to represent different areas of the world, and each country is represented by a line starting at a common centerpoint. This makes it easy to grasp the difference in median ages from say, Africa to Europe. Some African countries have a median age of 14, which could be due to inadequate healthcare, resources, or nation turmoil, while in Europe, the median age varies around age 40. 

I think the unique radial layout makes the visual more appealing, and the different colors make the varying areas distinct to the eye.
