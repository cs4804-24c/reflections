This visual shows how different education and development metrics have changed over the last 10 years.

This visual while it looks nice, I am not a fan of it. 

It lacks initial interpertation as it takes awhile to understand what is happening. The main data that is being shown here is how the metric has changed from 2011 to 2020. This change is depcited in the difference in size of the circles. This is hard to distinguish as the circles are so small to begin with. Further, the different rings show different metrics, but they also have the circles on different segments of the overall circle, so it is a bit confusing on why some metrics are on the top of the circle vs the bottom.

The best visual element of this visual story board is the visual on the bottom depicting the expected years of schooling. I think this visual is the best as it is the largest and it labels the data points so the user does not need to hover over to get the information. 

The last thing that is bad with this visual is that the explanation paragraph on the left does not line up with the information shown.
