This week I wanted to learn something new not just about a type of visual but about something in the article and that came when I found this
article https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/06/09/health/noise-exposure-health-impacts.html?unlocked_article_code=1.H00.ZCLc.junV7ijZmVWC.
It was intresting on how sound can have a harmful impact on your health. I also did not know before that db scale was logrithmic. The article also
interactive with sound which makes sense but isn't that common so it was intresting to see. The article did a good job creating a story as you
scrolled through updating the info and the graphics as you go. I thought the part with the body showing how the body interacts to loud noise was
nicely done. The pace of the article was also well planned out it didn't just through all the visuals at you at once. Overall, this was a well worth
read and it keep the reader engaged and intrested.
