This visualization depicts the time spent (in days) that an average American will spend on various tasks over the course of their life. My favorite part of this visualization is the story it tells, as you start in the top left hand corner, move around the circle, then end in the right bottom hand corner. The text walks you through a number of different statistics before leaving you with an emotional message about the time each of us has to do the things we love. Each day is a dot, with different colors representing different activities. The visualization adds a level of impact by incorporating interactivity. Mousing over a dot in one of the circles will cause the central circle to only display those color points and tell you to total percentage of days that activity makes up. Mousing over a point in the central circle just gives you the specific activity moused over and the percentage of days it makes up. A good spread of colors are used with geographic separation to help those with colorblindness issues. The accompanying text is absolutely appropriate and completes the graphic in my view. I only have a few complaints, one being that the pink points in the upper left hand corner are not interactive like the rest of the points and are not bounded by an appropriately colored circle like the categories. In addition the text in the grey portions of the graphic are not bolded like the white text in the black portion of the graphic, which looks a little off in my opinion.
