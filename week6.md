This graph displays US electricity sources and its location. This visualization grabbed my intitial glance due to the design of the
data. The data is displayed over a night background of the United States and uses colorful bubbles to interept the various electricity
sources. The Bubbles grow in size by how much MW output the electricity source gives but the use of opacity and colors makes it easy to
distinguish the sources even with the mass amount of bubbles that are in the data. Not only does it have a great data visualization of
country with its data points but also give a simple to read table/legend to understand the graph even more. You are also able to hover
over the bubbles and it will show you specific information on that data point. you can navigate through easily and could zoom in and out
to get a closer look at locations or view the country as a whole.

There is one color they use for coal, a dark grey, that gets lost sometimes with the background and between the other colors which i
would change.
