 For this reflection I chose a more peculiar data visualization. A couple who met through collaborating on a data visualization project decided to tie in dataviz into their party favors/badges. The couple decided on a design that would visualize how long each of their guest knew the pair and how they met them. The visualization was in the shape of a heart, with each lobe being either the groom or the bride. The size of the lobe would indicate the length of the relationship and the color would be the type of relationshhup. Because of the heart shape of the visualization, it is harder to compare how long the guest has known the couple. It is interesting to note that the couple was mindful in setting a minimum size to how small the lobe could be (indicating length of relationn). This was done so guests that had recently met the couple, still had fun looking badges. The data visualization was done using R and ggplot. Using these tools they would label each plot with the guest name and have two dots - with color and size adjusted accordingly. Then using Adobe Illustrator the graphic was designed to look like the heart and match the color scheme of the wedding. At the end, they created a network diagram of all the guests.
