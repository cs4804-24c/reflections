This week, I looked at NYT's "How Much Hotter Is Your Hometown Than When You Were Born?"

The article features two visualizations. For the first visualization, you enter your hometown and your birthyear (or an arbitrary location & year), and it displays a line chart up depicting the number of days in each year that were at least 90 degrees.
Scrolling further adds a prediction for up to 2089, with an area line chart used to depict the range of estimates. I think this graph does a good job at taking a simple dataset and displaying it in a way that makes the viewer invested in the data.
I think a lot of people have heard complaints about how it was never this hot in the summer, and putting in your own information lets the viewer prove that it is in fact hotter more often during summer.
Like many of the NYT's other visualizations, they take advantage of updating the visual as you scroll to explain the visualization in more detail and to reduce the amount of information introduced all at once.

The page also includes a secondary visualization showing the predicted number of hot days in the form of a heat map on a 3D globe.
The second visualization is a simple heatmap, but has a really cool feature in that it starts off by focusing on the location you entered originally.
This ultimately doesn't mean much, since you can drag the globe to freely rotate it, but it provides continuity between the globe and the original graph, and makes it easier to compare your hometown to the rest of the world.
I do think the heatmap is a slightly flawed choice, just because it is easy to think of it as temperature increase in that format. While the number of 90 degree days is strongly correlated with an increase in the average temperature, it could be misleading for certain areas of the globe.
