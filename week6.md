Reflection:

David McCandless created an interesting infographic combining multiple data visualizations about oil.
The infographic contains graphics such as a tree map, sankey diagram, a alternative pie chart, and more.
What I found most intriguing was the combination of the tree map with the sankey diagram.
The creator had the rectangle for Russia bleed into a sankey diagram below where it broke down where Russian Gas went.
I've personally never seen someone transition their data information like this and thought that it was very neat and creative.
And below that, there is another visualization to show the percent depedency on Russian Gas exports.
The flow of the infographic was very clean and smooth and easy to understand.
The only negative I would say is the weird alternative pie chart that is towards the bottom.
I found it hard to read and understand as it wasn't divided like a normal pie chart.
It was divided in weird shapes throughout the circle, with no obvious pattern.
Overall though, this is one of the best infographics I've seen and I give a lot of credit to the creator for being creative with it.
