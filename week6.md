This vis covers the jobs that certain races are more likely to have. It shows a plot of circles of different sizes, each of which are ranked on a vertical axis of multipliers, indicating how likely they are to have the job when compared to the average. The vis type is called beeswarm, which is refreshing to learn, since I've seen a couple of these before and thought they were just a special type of force directed graph -- it makes sense now, since when you change the settings of the vis, the nodes move like a raging beeswarm.

One thing I'm still wondering is what the size of the nodes represents. Logically, it would be the number of occupants total, but it would be great if the author indicated that explicitly. Also, I'm assuming due to the nature of beeswarm charts, some nodes are placed in areas they aren't supposed to be in. In this graph, some nodes are placed above the "average" when they are supposed to be below it, but perhaps that's a deeply rooted techinical problem that is hard to fix. The filters are nice to cycle through different races and see what each race has to offer, but it would also be nice to see based on location, as there are definitely some places that have different demand markets, which would shift the spread of occupations for the entire population, let alone each race. What's also interesting is why some nodes are shifted horizontally, when all of them should be clustered towards a central vertical axis. Maybe a bug/glitch? We'll never know. One last thing is perhaps having a summary of the vis/data to show certain insights that would great to learn at a quick glance, as the chart is somewhat of an information overload, especially with the copious amounts of small dots that are hard to hover over.
