The graph above shows the ice coverage of the Great Lakes this year when compared to the ice coverage over time of every other recorded year.  The currect year's data is represented by the blue line.
The average is represented by the dotted line. Every other year is represented by the gray lines. The data in this graph is alarming, this year so far has to lowest ice coverage on the Great Lakes.
It is well below the average, and considering climate change it is likely that next year will have a lower ice coverage than this year. However, this graph relies on previous knowledge a lot and isn't
the most intuitive. Every year other than 2024 is gray and it creates a "spaghetti" of lines that is indicipherable other than knowing that it is made of previous data. Hoenstly, the graph would be far
easier to read if it just showed the average line and the previous few years. It is hard to read without basic background knowledge.
