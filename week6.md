This stood out to me because I haven't seen too many food-related visualizations, especially not on the consumer budgeting end. The goal of this one is to show the most cost effective, viable source of protein by comparing how much protein you get for your money with how much of that food is actually protein.
This also reminded me of the income and expenses diagram I looked at a few weeks ago, because it relates to personal financial decisions and can help people make their own informed decisions.
What I immediately noticed is how clean and clear it is, due to the black background and the color-coded food groups. It's very easy to look at, and my eyes aren't drawn to any particular place so I'm able to absorb all the information equally. The grid lines could be more substantial though, which would make it easier to see the actual numbers associated with the food rather than just where it stands relative to other foods.
I also noticed some confusing trends, specifically that legumes were "the best" and vegetables were "the worst" in terms of cheap viable protein. But I soon realized that the x axis takes into account grams and not calories. So you can't tell just from this visualization whether or not a food is "mostly protein" when it comes to macronutrients. This is a bit confusing at first, but I understand why they did it this way. This focuses on answering a specific question, "what should I buy if I'm on a budget and want to eat more protein", rather than getting into details about calories or micronutrients or whatever.
Also there are just a lot of factors that play into this, such as local food prices and raw vs cooked weight. This is a complex topic so it can be challenging to capture all its elements in a way that relates to the most people on a national or even international scale. This data would mean very little to someone who lives someplace where certain food groups are more accessible and affordable. And certain foods are more affected than others when it comes to protein density pre and post cooking.
Overall I think this is a good visualization that accomplishes what it's trying to accomplish. It can be a little misleading or even incorrect depending on your goals and where you live, but I think it captures the general trends of protein density and cost. I also think it's interesting how posts like this inspire people to comment about their favorite protein sources. It's a good source of engagement, both positive and negative.
