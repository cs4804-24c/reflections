Visualization Reflection:

In this data visualization article, author and DataWrapper visualization team member Luc Guillemot discusses population growth in Germany using an interactive connected scatter plot. In particular, Guillemot explores the relationship between migration and population growth in Germany over the past 72 years in his connected scatter plot (second data visualization shown in the article) titled "Germany's population growth has been driven by immigration." As this is my first time diving into the nuances of a connected scatter plot, there are a number of design features that positively shape the user experience of interpreting and interacting with this visualization. In relation to the x-axis corresponding to the total population in Germany and the y-axis corresponding to the net migration rate, the first design feature that catches my eye is the inclusion of labels inside the chart detailing information about world events and immigration. These labels improve the user experience as they provide proper context for the visual changes in the net migration rate and total population of Germany illustrated on the scatter plot. In addition to the contextual labels in the chart, another clever design scheme that I agree with is the use of color to mark different sections of the connected dots in conjunction with the interactive tooltip for each dot. A transition in color along the connected dots signifies a change in the way that the total population of Germany is trending (either now increasing or decreasing), and this transition becomes apparent to the user when they hover over a dot and activate the tooltip. This interactive tooltip reports the current direction of change of both the net migration and total population (either increasing or decreasing), and this particular availability of information to the user on hover enables an accurate interpretation of the connected scatter plot data in each of the colored sections. Lastly, a key design feature that when left out would make this connected scatter plot incomplete is the inclusion of a time metric. There is an arrow labeled "Time follows the line" that clearly communicates to the user the idea that as you move along the line from left to right, the year corresponding to a certain total population in Germany increases. To assist the communication of this chart construct to the user, a select number of dots properly spaced out from each other are labelled with a year as well. In summary, Luc Guillemot's connected scatter plot is designed very elegantly such that the user is able to accurately interpret the visualized data through interacting with the chart and digesting the contextual labels.
