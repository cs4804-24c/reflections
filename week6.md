For this weeks reflection I chose [_The Worldâ€™s Most Powerful Passports in 2024_](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/worlds-most-powerful-passports-in-2024/) by Niccolo Conte

This visualization is a map of the world containing a data layer of countries with the most powerful passports. Each countries land is colored in depending on the amount of visa-free travel options they have, with the 
darker color signifiying the passport is visa free in more countries. Additionally, this visualization contains a sorted line graph, ranking countries from least powerful to most powerful in terms of visa free travel above 
the map. I like that this visualization has a lot of added text that are placed outside of the visualization, similar to an infographic. In particular, the line graph above the map adds a lot of context about 
different countries as it has flags below many notable countries at different points. The zoom in on European countries shows why these countries are important for this dataset, as most of the most powerful passports are 
located in this region, and the countries have smaller territories than others. The additional context makes this visualization easy to understand, and explains why some countries have one less visaless country than others 
(ex. USA vs AUS). I would've liked there to be a version with all the data presented, so I can further explore which countries have the least powerful passport. Additionally, it would be a good addition to make this interactable 
so there is no need to magnify over Europe and cover other countries. This would also assist with seeing microstates within Europe, such as San Marino and Liechtenstein. Lastly, it would be interesting to add a timeline below 
the map to see how these rankings have changed over the years, as countries relations have changed and new policies have been enacted.
