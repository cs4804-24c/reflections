The visualization I chose this week was inspired by Caitlin Clark defeating the all-time NCAA D1 women's basketball record for points scored. This visualization utilizes 
circles with varying shades of red and sizes to indicate the shots that she took during her freshman year vs her senior year. A darker red indicates that she was more accurate
in making shots than the D1 average, while a circle bounded by gray or black indicates levels below the D1 average. First, I thought it was interesting that they chose to 
use the D1 shooting average rather than her own shooting average. However this works well to compare her to the rest of the field, especially in the case where she is such
a standout shooter (#1 all time!). I am not sure why they were using shades of red to fill the circles that show a higher shooting average, and circles under the shooting 
average were all white, but instead had different color borders, with shades nearing black to indicate the lowest shooting percentages. The size of the circle indicates the 
number of shots that she took from that location, with a bigger circle indicating a higher number of shots. I liked this metric because it was very easy to tell visually 
how big the circles were in comparison to one another. The two metrics used in conjunction with one another do a great job to show where she shot most accurately, the most amount of 
times. Additionally, the commentary provided at the bottom and the reorganizaiton of the data points into groups really drive home the point that the visualization is trying to make,
that between her freshman and senior year, Clark is more selective with her shots, but is also more accurate with her baskets. Also, the difference in location of the shots
is striking, because the visualization clearly shows that she takes noticeably less shots from the mid-range now, instead choosing to shoot mostly from either under the basket
or from beyond the three-point line, which are much more accurate shots.
