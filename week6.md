I decided to do this week’s reflection on a piece done by Kirell Benzi that tracks the connections between the 20,000-plus characters that exist in the Star Wars universe. Each character is represented by a single node. And each of these nodes is connected by a color-coded line (or ‘edge’) to related nodes. Red represents the dark side of the force; blue represents the light side; yellow shows criminals and bounty hunters. The piece is one of multiple that she has done on the Star Wars Universe. 

I thought it was a very entertaining visualization and one that was beautifully done. I liked how colorful it was, and I thought the artist made a good choice of using a dark color in the background to emphasize the   While it perhaps doesn’t allow for users to navigate the visualization and see who all the different characters in the picture are, the piece was created with the intention of creating art with data, not to present data for the sake of presenting it. I suppose it wasn’t made to be analyzed, but rather, admired. Unfortunately because it was a visualization made purely for aesthetic purposes, there’s not much else to cover.
