This week I looked at ancestory.com to find visualizations of family trees. I love the way the layered graphs are organized and how simple these graphs can be made.
Seeing the exponential increase in family members is also amazing to see and graphs like this are extremeley useful to manage and organize data. I also like how on some
of the graphs they are color coordianted by years and the shades of the colors change as time passes. Overall these trees are compact and make it so you need to have a lot of room to
create them but they are very interesting to see when they become complex.
