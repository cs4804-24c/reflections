Reflection: 
This week I decided to look through news articles to find an interesting visualization. The article I found is about 
inflation in America throughout 2023. This article had a few good visualizations, but I think the best one was the 
first one, Watching Inflation. I think the colors chosen for the visualization were very good, especially how the 
creator utilized different shades to convey different levels of rising and falling inflation. The red to symbolize an 
increase in inflation worked well with user intuition about the color red. I also think blue was a good choice 
because it gave the visual that the prices were cooling off and declining. I also really liked how they included the 
legend at the top of the visualization to display what the meaning behind the colors and what each shade meant within
the visualization. One thing I really did not like is how the darkest blue was -30% but the darkest red was only +15%. 
I think this makes the visualization misleading to the reader because there is a lot more red than blue on the vis, so
even if there is a lot of medium red and medium blue, the medium red shade is actually much more impactful than the 
medium blue. I do however think that the popups that appear over each square when you hover helps to make the vis more 
clear. The popups provides the exact percentage of increase or decrease for the price of that month, to help make up for
the lack of clarity provided by the color shades. I also liked how they decided to include a row for overall inflation 
at the top of the vis, instead of only having rows for each category.
