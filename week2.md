Title: How Houthi Attacks Have Upended Global Shipping
Many ships are not going through the Suez Canal route because of  Houthi militia attacks in the Red Sea. Instead they are opting for a longer route around Africa. These on going attacks have disrupted shipping, leading to increased costs, delayed arrivals, and rising insurance premiums for companies. Shipping companies increased container prices from Asia to Europe, which can lead to inflation. Plenty of retailers have warned that there will be delays in product shipment and rise in consumer prices. The Red Sea's significance in global trade, especially in oil and LNG shipments, adds complexity to the situation. The us navy has tried to help the situation by shooting down drones and missiles. However, this process is costly. 
The map data illustrates the changing paths of ships navigating the Red Sea. It shows the positions of 3,461 cargo vessels recorded at entrances to the Red Sea over the last three months. The shipping routes before the Houthi attacks, covering Nov. 1 to Nov. 15, and  the regular paths of the vessels. This can be seen with green lines. With purple lines the data shoes after the attacks, positions from Jan. 1 to Jan. 15 depict altered routes as ships detour around the Red Sea, highlighting the impact of the disruptions on global shipping patterns.
