This site contains different visualizations on NBA player shot charts / heat maps. The reason I find this so interesting is because the heat maps give you a better look at a players habits
and where they like to shoot from. The other visualizations give a better description on their tendencies. for example the left and right side of the court.
The bar charts, although simple give a really interesting perspective on how the player performs against other teams by percentage and points per game.
I dont really like how the site is organized and how the graphs are so close to each other. I think having the graphs be seperate and shown as you scroll down would make it easier
to read.
I would set up this site differently to better organize the charts and have an option to choose what type of chart people want to see
