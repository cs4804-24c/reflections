Analysis
<br>

This cartoon by Dr. Siouxsie Wiles and illustrator Toby Morris demonstrates how you can easily simplify data to get it across to people as well as make it entertaining. By showing it as a cartoon rather than just as a graph it allows the reader to see what happens when each character's advice is taken seriously. When the man in the blue shirt says that "Whatever, It's just like the cold or flew" it is implying that no preventative tasks are taken. In this appraoch the line representing the number of cases of coronavirus exceeds the line representing the health care system's capacity, implying that many people would die. However, the women in the orange shirt says "Don't panic but be careful" as well as displaying tips on how to limit the spread. When her approach is implied to be followed the number of cases of coronavirus is below the health care limit ensuring that there are less deaths. 

Additionally, the animation allows the viewer to easily compare and contrast the two scenarios. Rather than having a stale academic graph, this graph is far more easily followed and more abstract. During the time it was released, everybody who even looked at the news would know about coronavirus and health care capacity. Even if the reader didn't know about either, with basic knowledge of English it is easy to infer what is happening. This cartoon is a masterpiece in showing how to create engaging graphs, it is eye catching, easy to digest, informative, and pleasing to the eye.
