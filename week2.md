Visualization Reflection:

In TheUpshot article, "Explore How Income Influences Attendance at 139 Top Colleges", authors Aatish Bhatia and Claire Cain Miller go through a series of data visualizations and commentary that explain the reasons why many of America's top colleges favor admittence of students from wealtheir families and background. The most interesting data visualization that caught me eye in terms of content and design is the first one that appears in the article, which is an interactive line chart with adjustable data based on the the selected university. For each selected university locked in using the "Look up colleges here:" dropdown menu, the line chart right below shows who attends the given university compared to the average attendance rate by parent income (the x-axis uses parent income by percentile and the y-axis uses attendance rate compared to the average). There are some intriguing design choices built into this line chart that I agree with. In addition to the ability to select which university data to render on the line chart, there are also two tabs that the user can select to toggle data accounting for either all test-taking students or only students who have equal test scores. When the data by test-taker category is toggled, there is also a smooth transition animation that occurs between the visualizations for each of the datasets for the selected university. This smooth animation is a great feature because it makes it easier for the user to digest how the visualization for the all test-taking students dataset differs from the visualization for the only students who have equal test scores dataset. Another great design choice is that this line chart also includes interactive tooltips for each parents' income rank percentile on the x-axis; when the user hovers the mouse over each percentile on the line, an information box pops up giving the exact proportion on the y-axis for the current percentile of family incomes. A third key design choice in this line chart is an included horizontal line marking the average attendance rate for the selected university, which gives the user spatial context for the attendance rate proportions reported in each tooltip. With that being said, a design choice that I disagree with is the exclusion of a proper y-axis label; even with the use of interactive tooltips and a horizontal average attendance rate marker, there should still always be a clear y-axis label for every line chart. In this case, the label could be named "Attendance Rate Proportional to the Average Attendance."
