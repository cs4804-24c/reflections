This vis shows a sales analysis for Adidas. It provides a comprehensive view of the company's sales, using a vareity of methods, like charts, graphs, and maps to help enhance the reader's perspective on the data. I thought it was nice to include this variety and see where all the data comes from, since often only one side of the picture is presented. Showing the regional markets raised some questions for me, as I would think that the top markets would reside in the most populous cities like NYC and SF, which are up there, but not #1. Instead, it's Charleston, which I didn't expect. It also shows things like the efficiency of sales methods and price optimizations, which people wouldn't normally show, as it would just be as simple as showing how much revenue was generated last year, or something like that. It was also nice to include the general Tableau dashboard and predictive sales analysis, which respectively covered the entire dataset in a holistic manner and gives a powerful way to measure future trends based on historical patterns. However, on a high UX level, it was hard to see which anaylses were more important the others (subjective, ofc). At first glance, it was all under the same hierarchy so I didn't know what to focus on and spent a lot of time trying to see what each one was trying to describe. Some visualizations were also very small and blurry, but that's a simple fix :)
