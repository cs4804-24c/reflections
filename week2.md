This week I was intrested in looking more into parallel coordinates which we saw last week in class. This is a relatively new data visualization
technique for me so I thought that I would explore it. I came across this visualization https://syntagmatic.github.io/parallel/ which I thought
showed an example of parallel coordinates fairly well. This visualization takes USDA nutrients data an plots the different nutrient data points
for each individual item in the data set. It breaks down the data into groups and sorts them by color allowing for further distinction
between the lines. In addition, this visualization allows for interaction by being able to select parts of the graph to see what lines flow
through that segmant. This allows a user to explore visually different combos of nutrient data points to see what food items fall within that
combination. Meanwhile as you are interacting with the chart the table updates showing you the exact data, and the pie cahrts update giving you a 
sense of the data you have selected. Overall, I think that this is a great example of parallel coordinates, however It is not immediatley clear
how to use the visual but they do have a tutorial link. I believe parallel coordinates can be an effective visualiztion tool but they are not
universal approach and can struggle when there is a lot of data.
