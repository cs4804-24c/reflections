This is an article about using 3d visualizations in order to visualize data from
single cell RNA sequence data sets. The goal of the research was to find ways to
visualize vast amounts of data, especially for plants with single cell resolution. To do this, the
the authors used Blender.
The result of the research is that the authors created a tool that provides a proof 
concept method for visualizing complex scRNA-seq datasets in a "simple and cohesive manner".
The specific visualization is a 3d  model with a heat map that represents different types of gene 
expression/cell types within the root meristem. This visualization is very easy to read, even if
you don't understand the underlying concepts of microbiology that it represents. One of the drawbacks
is that this visualization can take a lot of computing power. The heatmap for the 3d renderings, 
at least the one in the article, does not have its own heat map; it uses one from a different 
visualization on which it is based. It seems like this style of visualization may 
benefit from helper visualizations Additionally, this type of visualization requires manual
3d modeling, and can be expensive to make. Despite this, rapid advancements in technology are likely
to make this type of visualization widely used in the field of microbiology.
