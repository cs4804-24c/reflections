I remembered during our first class we looked at a graph on the amount of people entering the United States through the southern border with Mexico. The graph was very easy to read as it displayed its
data in a "waterfall" type of visual where the main data (migrantes) flowed through various categories. I came across this data visual of the same type of graph but in a horizontal form with Apple Q4
revenue data which, in my opinion, is indeed a little bit harder to read compared to a vertical version. The flow of data like a river streaming off is still a unique way to display data in an
appropriate manner that gives the viewers perspective another layer of conceptializing the information.

The coloring used is also a very good touch by the creator because it utilizes colors that humans automaticaly associate with good and bad, green and red. On the right side of the graph, the profits
and expenses are diagrammed out using green and red, repectively, to make it easy for viewers to glipse at the numbers without reading the description and infer that these are the gains and losses of
the company for the quarter. The visualization also uses gray for the revenue gained from Apples various products sold which are used as the base for the profits and expensises section. Each section has
a label for what it represents as well. For example, the Apple services section shows each service that is contributing to the revenue with its logo widget making it easy for viewers to know what
exactly consists of these sections.

From the data standpoint, its probably a good idea to buy some Apple stock.
