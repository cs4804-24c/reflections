This article discusses the issue of generative AI models (in this case Stable Diffusion) implementing harmful racial and gender stereotypes into its image generation. This can have extreme negative effects on society as AI is used in more and more cases, "further perpetuating stereotypes that threaten to stall progress toward greater equality in representation and potentially resulting in unfair treatment."

For this study, researchers "prompted the text-to-image model to create representations of workers for 14 jobs â€” 300 images each for seven jobs that are typically considered 'high-paying' in the US and seven that are considered 'low-paying.'" The concerning results are displayed in the data visualization below.

After showing each of the images generated by the AI, the visualization changes each of these images into a box with the color of the generated person's skin tone. When the the reader keeps scrolling, each of these boxes is then organized into groups under the job title the image was generated for. This clearly shows that the skin color of the workers is not even close to being evenly distributed under each job title.

The boxes then change color and are quickly reorganized to show the gender breakdown of each image generated under each job title, showing gender inequality.

At the end of the visualization, the researchers also provide the "average" person generated for each of the job titles, which is done by finding the average color and position of each pixel.

**My reflection of this visualization:** I found this data visualization to be extremely creative, engaging, and impactful. I think the visualization uses the data as a tool to clearly display the biases that this generative AI model had, which was the goal of the article. The animations of each data point encourage the reader to continue scrolling through the article and ensure that not too much information is displayed on the screen at once. This has shown me how animated and interactive data visualizations can do a great job of displaying large amounts of data. Starting with each data point as the original generated image was also a good way to help the reader understand what the article was discussing, as some readers may be less familiar with AI and its ability to generate images of humans. This also reminds the reader about the large amount of data used, making the findings more reliable. I also loved how the visualization animated the images changing to the skin color associated with them in the study, as this showed the process used by the researchers to convert each image to one color. Each job category and skin color is also clearly defined, making the visualization easy for the reader to understand. I also really like the way that this visualization transitions from quantitative data with each data point and breakdown shown in the beginning to a more qualitative result in the end with the "average" person generated under the job position, which is easier for the reader to digest and take away. 

One suggestion I have for how to improve this visualization is for the job categories to stay in the same place as the user scrolls. While I understand that the order of the boxes changes between the skin color breakdown and the gender breakdown to show each box in order from "greatest to least" of a certain value, the order does not switch to follow this format in the following animation about men with lighter skin colors. I think it would be best for each job category to remain in the same place for the entire animation, because all the boxes moving quickly can be overwhelming for the reader, so they may not even realize that the labels have changed. My second suggestion for improvement involves the colors in the visualization about men with lighter skin tones. For the average reader quickly viewing this animation, the colors of this visual being the same as the colors in the visualization about all people's skin tones can make it a bit confusing to know that this visual is about men only. I think instead, the author should have picked one color, such as red, and filled in each box to show the percent of that box that is males with lighter skin colors. The reader was able to see the skin color breakdown earlier in the visualization, so it is not essential to show this breakdown again. I also think it could be helpful to "highlight" some trends like this in the data in a more isolated way, to ensure that the reader is seeing all the interesting trends and results that the author sees. 

Another thing that could make this visualization even more powerful would be to include the actual percentage of men, women, and others that work particular jobs to show how some of these steryotypes have been intensified by the AI. For example, less than 1% of the engineer images generated were of women. While it is true that a smaller proportion of the STEM field are women, women represent far more than 1% of the field, showing how the AI has magnified this issue.
