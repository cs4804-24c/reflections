In this reflection, I decided to focus on a visualization relating to the opioid crisis, and I found a fantastic, very creative data visualization about deaths caused by overdosing on different kinds of opioids, especially highlighting the FDA approved and lawfully acquired opioids, and the ones that  were illegal and/or created synthetically. 

The article is cleverly titled, the Spiraling Opioid Epidemic in America, to reference the Spiraling data visualization that shows the number of deaths caused by overprescription of pain meds for pain relief, deaths caused by heroin overdoses, and deaths caused by synthetic opiates over the years. They did a good job highlighting how there were essentially three waves of opioid related deaths, the first wave primarily consisted of overprescription, the second being mainly heroin-overdose deaths, and the third consisting of deaths from overdosing on synthetic opiates like fentanyl. 
 
There were more small visualizations to further help readers understand the magnitude of the issue, and the dangers associated with using such substances, and I thought the visualization did a good job of getting their point across clearly in a manner that was visually pleasing to people and therefore more attention-grabbing.
