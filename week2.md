From a site called [pudding.cool](https://pudding.cool/), they published a story in September 2023 titled ["Watch 24 hours of an American day, and the invisible crisis hiding in plain sight."](https://pudding.cool/2023/09/invisible-epidemic/)

The site is essentially a study on how the typical American spends their 24 hours on a weekend day in 2021, specifically the hidden prominance of loneliness and how the pandemic has kicked the problem up a notch.

Introduced towards some characters around the start of the day:

A new visual that they introduce later on is a yellow color representing the time spent amongst close ones.

We can see it getting updated throughout the day:

Later graphs show a consistent decrease in time spent with family across all age groups (especially the "34 or younger" group), as well as time spent with friends.

Another visual aspect that gets introduced to our grid of characters is the Cantril ladder, where 10 represents the best spot in your life, and 0 representing the worst possible life:

As we near the end of the day around 6:30PM, a trend begins to appear as the characters are sorted by both Catril Ladder resposnes and hours spent with close oens:

Using just two visualized pieces of data combined with a timeline paints a pretty good picture of how loneliness can affect people's outlook on life.
