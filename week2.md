Stacked area charts can be considered as basic area charts with the difference that it is the extension of the basic area chart. We can see the evolution of a numerical value for several distinct groups on one chart, stacked on top of each other. This stacked area chart is showing the evolution of a few baby names in the US on a specific time frame. These graphs are beneficial since we can study the evaluation of the whole and the relative proportions of each group. In this visualization, each segment of the area represents a different name. Also, the overall area represents the total number of occurrences over the specific time. For interpreting the results of this stacked area chart, we look at the y-axis to see the total value of the data and the x-axis to see the time period. Each color in the chart represents the value of a certain group in a given time. By the use of this visualization, we can see which names are contributing the most to the total. Also, we can see which name is selected more by comparing the heights of different names in a given time. Overall, this visualization shows the evaluation of baby name occurrence in the US between 1880 and 2020 and as we can see, between the years 1940 and  1960, the two names of Patricia and Linda were common compared to other names listed in the graph.
