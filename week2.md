This visualization examines the ethnic composition of the 2010 census tracts.  

I am impressed by all of the information there is in this visual, as it works across the entire United States. An aspect I really like is the dynamic map key. As you zoom out the dot represents more and more people. This allows the user to gather information as zoomed in or out as they want, and not make the visual super crowded. Another aspect I like is the major cities on the bottom to allow the user to quickly get to/filter to that city. Additionally, when hovering over an area an information box pops up with the exact composition of the tract. Building on this idea, based on how zoomed in the user is, it will provide either the census tract or the county composition.

One thing that I think could be made better today is the smoothness of the visual. It takes some time to load when zooming in and out, and this is understandable because of the amount of data that is being shown. I think with the technology available today, someone could make this same visual that loads a lot faster.

If I create any map visuals I will definitely consider the dynamic map key and hover information as it maintains the information without overloading the screen.
