This visualization shows the revenue of different gaming platforms since the start of gaming as an industry. I like to learn about gaming and the history of it before I started playing games.
The type of chart used to visualize this is the best possible choice, showing revenue over time compared between multiple platforms. It also has major events for each platform that create ripples in the rest of the market.
These are usually games or advancements in technology that would set the standard for gaming going forth. Even emerging platforms like Cloud and VR are included, and will likely expand very soon. I would like to see more charts
like these going forward, since it is clear that gaming is not going away.
