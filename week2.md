*Viz Description*: A series of graphs comparing the wages of different demographics, specifically focused on highlighting union vs non-union pay.

*Reflection*:
  I was drawn to this visualization mainly because of its effectiveness in conveying the illustrator's personal beliefs through its stylistic choices, in addition to via the data patterns it highlights. Even without critically analzying what the data is showing (which is, universally, that joining a union increases a demographic's weekly pay), even just representing union wages as a hand being supported/pulled up by another and non-union wages as a single hand, unsupported and ostensibly reaching for more and/or help (that it will not get) adds a more positive connotation to unions. I like how Ms. Chalabi's style choices are not only aesthetically appealing, but provide additional context for viewers -- for example, someone who didn't know what unions are could likely infer at least that they are labor-oriented cooperatives from just these graphs. I like these details in this visualization, as it seems the views supported align with my own, but I do acknowledge that my argument here implies that stylistic choices, independent of the data they "decorate", in data visualization can just as easily mislead viewers (whether intentionally/maliciously or simply through bad design). **This could be an interesting avenue to explore through a project, actually -- creating visualizations that objectively show one thing but subjectively imply another. A showcase of irresponsible design.**
  Additionally, it seems Chalabi's motivation behind publishing this visualization was to draw attention to and voice her support for a contemporary social justice issue, in this case last year's WGA strike. I find this admirable, as I feel one of the core tenets of data visualization is to increase the accessiblity of information -- both in comprehensiblity and reach.
  I also like how Chalabi highlighted discrepencies between different demographics, especially marginalized ones, despite these data not being central to her main intention. I was personally very surprised that, over time, black union members actually came to earn less than white non-union members; this was opposite to my perception of both unions and civil rights. I wonder what sociopolitical factors influenced this, and **I wish I knew where to look to further investigate this.**
