This visualization displays the scale comparisons of different tesla factories. One thing I like about this is the smaller icons of products each factory produces, from Model Y teslas to 
battery packs and megapacks. One thing that is difficult to visualize is the actual size of each building within the pictures. The visualization includes a compass as well as a reference 
for miles and kilometers. If I could add something to the visualization, I would add the ability to inspect each building to see a more detailed view of the factories. This would especially 
be useful in the smaller factories like Giga New York and Mega Factory where it is very difficult to see the images of the factories. The Kato Factory is also so hard to spot that I missed 
it the first time looking at the visualization. Highlighting the factory or drawing a red circle around the tiny image could help make it stand out more. The icon with its description above 
seems a little bit unorganized. A way I would fix this is getting rid of the description and when you hover over the icons under each factory, it would then display more information like what 
type of model tesla the icon is and how many the factory produces per year. Overall I would say that this visualization does a good job when comparing the different sizes of scale for each 
factory, however the information on each factory could have been handled better.
