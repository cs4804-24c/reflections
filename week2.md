Life Expectancy Visualization:

Reflection:

Varun Sai Kanuri created visualizations of specific countries.
I personally dislike most of the graphs created.
The one graph I do enjoy is the "Life Expectancy Based on Countries status".
It clearly visualizes that developed countries have a more compact age range for life expectancy while developing countries have a wide range.
The other graphs created are very hard to read.
For example, the worse graph is "Country wise Life Expectancy over Years" graph doesn't properly update the legend with the slider, on top of that, I don't see a clear pattern in how the slider is ordered.
A slider with countries with no real ordering makes it difficult to find a specific country that I am looking for.
The other graphs are hard to read as well for a different reason.
They contain too many countries, making it hard to distiguish between the different data points. There are too many countries in the legend, and having a filter box would of been beneficial.
You can manually click the countries in the legend to turn them on/off but is not as straight forward and convienent as a filtering option.
The slider on these graphs are a drastic improvement.
Using years makes is clear and concise.
