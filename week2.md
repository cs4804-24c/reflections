This graph/data shows the percentage of poverty (proportion of employed population below the international poverty line 
of US$1.90 per day) throughout the world. I believe this data is interesting as it displays the map in a 3d prespective. 
It uses an isometric (parallel) projection which means that scale is equal in all directions across the entire 3D view. 
The height of the countries are dependent on the poverty rate, the higher the total is, the higher the elevation it is for the 
country. The elevation and poverty total ranges from 0 to 70,000,000. In addition, the map also provides colors, that somewhat 
represents a heat map. The color measures the percentage of poverty within the country. They used 5 different colors to from 
light tan to dark red, each presenting a range, from < 8% to > 54%.

The graph does a great job at capturing the attention of the audience. The colors are strategically used in similar way to a heat map,
but instead, the darker and redder regions are the ones with a higher percentage of poverty within the country/area. The graph also
makes it really easy to read with the different elevations representing the total number of people in poverty within the country.
Even, at a glance it is easy to see which countries have the highest total number and which countries has the highest percentage
of poverty. In addition, the legends are clear and readers can easily identify it and determine what the graph represents. One 
change I would make is probably change the text of the countries' name from light tan to dark than. This would make it easier
for readers to identify which country it is that they are looking at. Overall, this is a great visualization and a greta way to
display poverty totals and rates throughout the world.
