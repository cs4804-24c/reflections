This reflection is in response to the bubble chart under the header **bouncing back or staying down**. At first, this graph comfused me, but that's because I was looking at it on my phone! Seeing the full, uncropped graph, tells a clear story about hwo some activities became less popular in 2020 due to the pandemic and, subsequently, which of those regained their popularity.

The axis are the shift in popularity of activities within a range of years. The higher the value, the more time was spent on that activity. By plotting 2019-2020 vs 1029-2022, we can see which activities became fell in 2020 and stayed down, were more common in 2020 than 2019 and then returned to lower levels, were less common in 2020 than 2019 and then returned to higher levels, and which activities were more common in 2020 than 2019 and continued to become more popular as time went on.

The bubble size is how much time was spent on each activity in 2022: unrelated to the relative shift in popularity across years. Travelling to the gas station, for example, is less common in 2022 than it was in 2019, but it's still more popular than installing home security systems.

This chart uses the letters "hh" in several spots without explaining their significance. I have taken it to mean "household"â€” a noun adjunct. By this logic, "nonhh" means "non-household". I wish this had been explained on the chart.

It strikes me as odd that "arts and entertainment" were less common in 2020. I would expect it to follow the trend that "arts and crafts as a hobby" did, becoming more popular in 2020 and even moreso in 2022. Maybe "arts and entertainment" is referring to something more public, like an art museum or a live theater performance.
