This visualization shows Germany's population growth, as impacted by the net migration rate. It demonstrates population change with a very unique take, so while a little confusing at first, it makes sense after it clicks. Additionally, the visualization includes certain facts that explain the population changes, further emphasizing the changes as both a visual and a possible reason. Furthermore, color is used to indicate differences between periods of population increase and decline. Colored is population increase, while grey is population decline. This highlight helps the viewer to follow the trajectory, in addition to the little note made at the starting point.  
While well-made and interesting, I think a few edits can be made to improve this visualization. The X-axis currently shows 70,000 to 84,000. At some point, it should be mentioned that this is 70,000k to 84,000k. The visualization can also be expanded on, maybe to be about Germany's greater population and the different parts that impact population, including a line for changes in natural births and deaths, and more.
