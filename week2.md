This visualization show information about the satellites that are in orbit around the earth. It makes an excellent use of multiple layered design features to give information on different aspects of the satellites depicted. The use of shapes layered on color layered on size really is very powerful in terms of depicting multiple aspects of the satellites, especially since the visualization doesn't use overlapping circles on an xy grid, so details don't get obscured under the weight of the data. Grouping the colors with themselves keeps the visual readable where mixing might have made it chaotic and more difficult to parse. The accompanying information is in the style that matches the rest of the graphic, and is informative while not taking away from main visualization. The orbit ranges are separated by large white lines that then clearly lead to information on what each of the orbit categories means in terms of distance from the earth's surface. The regions are also clearly separated and labeled, the groupings based on region/country being easy to read. There are only a few things I might change about this. For one the use of shade to indicate satellite age is subtle to the point of being difficult to pick out. Secondly, the very small size of some of the satellites on the low end of the weight range makes them difficult to pick up additional information on. It also might have been nice to add a small section of text explaining the number of countries that are a part of the 'other' category.
