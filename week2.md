The visualization that I chose this week comes from the New York Times and depicts the changings in the last 60 years of NCAA football conference compositions. 
My first thought was that this visualization does its best at conveying a large amount of data over a long period of time, meaning that it would be difficult 
to condense this data visually even more and have it still make sense. However, it still is a little overwhelming to the viewer to have this amount/length of visual
to take in, which is one of my first critiques. The change in color along with the shifting arrows marking a team's change in conference is very clear visually
to the viewer, but having all of the rest of the lines in the same color gray make it difficult to read. It is still difficult despite the viewer's ability to hover over 
a team's line and have it become darker. If I were to make a change, I might make each conference a different color and show the movement of a team to another conference
by having the arrow along with a gradient transition between the colors of the conferences. Another aspect of this visualization that is a little unclear is that some teams
have a abrupt start or end in the same color as a team that is changing conferences. It is a little unclear as to what this means - did the team disband? One thing I 
found very useful about this visualization was the ability to highlight a specific team using a dropdown menu bar at the top. This was useful because it highlighted the 
entirety of the team's history in a bright yellow, making it incredibly distinct from the rest of the visualization. Overall I believe that this visualization does an 
adequate job of conveying the data it means to, but there are also several improvements and streamlines that could be made.
