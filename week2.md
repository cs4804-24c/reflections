<h1>Week 2 Reflection</h1>
<p>Over the summer, I interned at Nike and had the opportunity to work at their company headquarters in Portland, OR. At the headquarters, their campus features beautifully and thoughtfully designed buildings based off of their signed athletes. One of my favorite buildings I explored was the <a href="https://serenawilliamsbuilding.nike.com/greatness/artwork-tour">Serena Williams</a> building, particularly for this data visualization called <a href="https://www.danielcanogar.com/work/pulsation">Pulsation</a> by <a href="https://www.danielcanogar.com/home">Daniel Canogar</a> that served as an art installation outside the building to represent Serena. Canogar used data from wearable sensor technology that measured Serenaâ€™s heart rates, distance, pace and speed during her exercise routines and most iconic games along with online real-time data related to Serena. With this data, he was able to create algorithms to generate unique semi-abstract animations and designs. The visualizations are projected on four LED screens. There are 4 different variations of the visualizations, each variation using a different type of data and design. The first variation uses videos of Serena playing at the Grand Slam tournaments that shoot up the screen with a rippling trail. The second variation uses videos of Serena in action at her major tournaments and the colors of different tennis courts to create a liquid-like animation. The third variation generates particles based on how popular tennis-specific vocabulary is on the internet. The fourth variation uses data on the most searched sports topics on Google Trends. This installation is a perfect example of how versatile data visualization is, and how it can not only be used to show and represent data but also as an art form.
