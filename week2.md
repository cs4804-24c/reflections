This data visualization was published by the New York Times as a part of an article discussing the disparities between the amount of students universities have from the top 1% and bottom 60%. The article highlights how although elite colleges often promote free tuition for students with financial need, the likelihood of these students getting accepted is extremely low. Students attending elite colleges are richer than expected. Whereas, less than 1% of students from the bottom 20% attend an elite university and less than 50% attend college at all. The data visualization does a good job at demonstrating how different the college careers of students from the top 1% and bottom 20% transgress. I would have preferred a better method of labeling since I currently have to look back and forth to see what each set of colors mean. Additionally, the names of the colleges looked squished inside of each of the boxes, which makes them quite hard to read. It would have been neat to see the names of more of the colleges and see where they stand in their admissions. Perhaps a bar chart would have been better at comparing where the top 1% and bottom 20% go to college, but the feature of seeing the colleges that contribute greatly to this would be loss. Although the disaparities are jarring, it's good to see that there's less elite colleges that help with economic mobility.
