An interesting visualization that I came across was from "Proverty and Access to Internet, by County" from the Social Determinants of Health (SDOH Database) runned by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. In this day and age internet access is the main mode of communication for telemedicine and as an access point for basic healthcare access. Internet is the hub for an American to get access to maintain a sustainable lifestyle. This visual is a map that is interactive showcasing the data of the American Community Survey of 5 years (2014-2018). The visual is interactive to specifiy the data points from 'any broadband, including cellular', 'no computing device', 'smartphone only, no other device', and 'percent in poverty', with breakdown of each state. To add to this visual it also have the state and its corresponding county that is affected by the four categories that were mentioned. The choice of color for the heap map is compatable for color bindness and has a stark difference to identify county quintiles. The color distribution makes it simile to folow the heirarchy. The interactiveness of the visual makes it easier to see the brakedown of the county in each state. Something that I like alot is that the ability to hover over a specific county and have the corrrespoding statistics show up since have the actual numbers makes it easier to conceptualize. However something that I would have like to see is the progression throughout the years, did it get better or worse to have access to the internet. i understand the data is presented as a collection of the years but I would have wanted to see individiual years.
