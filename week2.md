NCEI US Tornado Statistics 1950-2023

This graphic, compiled using NOAA data and rendered with "ZingChart", is a graphic representing the number of tornadoes in given months, their associated fatalities, and a long term average tornado count (I think) represented as the horizontal red line.
This graphic uses a javascript library called ZingChart, as mentioned earlier, which I have not heard of before but seems decently useful given the features that this visualization has.
Some of these features that I would like to highlight include the ability to select custom timescale values, selecting certain months of data, and enabling and disabling the deaths line graph over the top of the standard bar chart. 
Probably the coolest aspect of the visualization though is the ability to change the time range and scale that are visible on the bottom slider of the visualization.
For me this was a pretty intuitive interface and I liked how I could zoom out to get the big picture as well as zoom in to see specific areas in more detail.
Further improving this section of the visualization is the "preview" area in the slider so that you aren't blindly dragging around your viewing window to different sections of the graph.
All of this being said, I do think there are some issues with this visualization.
Firstly, what is going on with this red line?
I assume that this is the average number of tornadoes over all time, but this isn't explicitly stated anywhere so I am literally guessing.
Beyond this, there are definitely some data cluttering issues when you start to overlay the fatalities on top, since this draws a second blue horizontal line as well as the line graph on top of the already existing data.
Overall, this visualization mainly introduced me to ZingChart as a library to look into in the future, but there were some decent takeaways from the visualization itself as well.
