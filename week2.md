I really like the concept of coming accross these visual aids naturally through every day life to reflect on. It seems less valuable if you actively seek out a graph for the sake of data vis. 
This bar graph shows the ages of the characters of the hobbit at the time of the movie. I enjoy the colours, and the way it comedically goes down in age until it hits gandalf who is over 55,000 years old. This graph came up when looking up the age of any of the characters, and was useful/fun to put things in perspective for the hobbit going to the lord of the rings. Of course, I hate the title as I can't really read it. The bar graph is plain and simple, but I feel this data doesn't need anything more. I also like the way it makes me think about what accuracy is needed. While we don't have exact ages for certain characters, it's within a range specific enough to give you all the context you need. It's the same thing with gandalf. It doesn't even tell you a general range, it just get's the point accross that he's absurdly old and that's all the matters.
