# Week 2 Reflection
For this week's reflection, I chose to look into NBA stats and different available visualizations. 

## Dunks and Threes

The first visualization I looked at was the player statistics page on [Dunks and Threes](https://dunksandthrees.com/), in particular [Jaylen Brown](https://dunksandthrees.com/player/1627759)'s statistics.
I found the visualizations on this page to be interesting because of how much data is available, as well as how it was presented. In particular, I found the graph titled Estimated Plus-Minus intriguing because I have
never seen a line graph containing multiple box plots within it. This box plot adds a lot of information on top of the line graph which shows the +/- average for the season, as it shows how much it varied and became skewed 
during a season. Additionally, you can click on one of the box and whisker plots in the graph, and the line graph to the right of it will show the +/- for every game in every season. This interactivity is useful to 
find out more about what was going on throughout the season, especially if one of the seasons has a different +/- than expected. Additionally, you can see the players full statistics in a table for a game by clicking on a data point
in the +/- season graph.

I also found going through the shooting tab on the website to be very interesting. It has the same first two types of graphs mentioned above (line + box plot, and a per-game line graph), but contains additional visualizations
for a player's shooting. I found the heat map of shots taken, titled Shot Density, to be very interesting. This density map clearly shows where Jaylen brown will be most likely to take a shot. Going through the season timeline,
it can be seen that Jaylen Brown has been taking fewer 3-point shot attempts this season compared to his previous four seasons. 

## Bucket List

Additionally, a few nights ago my roommates and I were watching the Rockets game and were interested in finding out if Luke Kornet has ever shot a three-point shot this season. In interest in finding out, I found a 
website called [Bucket List](https://bucketlist.fans) which shows the statistics of NBA players, similar to Dunks and Threes. Similarly to Dunks and Threes, this website also has a visualization of a basketball court
to show shot attempts. This website visualizes them a bit differently as it doesn't use a heatmap, but shows the amount of shot attempts by increasing the size of each hexagon on the court. The color of the hexagon shows
the players average points gained when they take that shot. I much prefer this visualization over the heatmap, as it shows more information as it easily shows the points per shot taken. A player could use this to determine which shot they need to work on, or how to set up plays to take a certain type of shot more often. 

After going to [Luke Kornet's](https://bucketlist.fans/player/nba/1628436) Bucket List page, we found that he hasn't taken a 3-point shot attempt since last season:

Additionally, you can find video clips of these plays when filtered down. This is Luke Kornet's last successful 3-point shot:
