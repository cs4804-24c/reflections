The visualization I chose for this week was an area chart representing Bolivia's exports during most of 2023. The main takeaway I get from the chart is that Bolivia exports gold more than anything else. I liked the use of the area chart because it helps to put into perspective how much of each resource it exports compared to the others. However, I feel sometimes our eyes can be slightly deceiving when viewing and comparing sizes of things that are not in the same shape. Due to this, I like that they include both a real dollar value for the exports as well as a percentage in the diagram. I also liked the color scheme, it grabbed my attention more than other graphs I was viewing. This led to me spending more time looking and internalizing the information. However, the colors were not too flashy and did not distract me from the information. I liked that they used the extra space in the block for gold to include the extra information. My only critique is I wish we had more information about what is included in the everything else block.
