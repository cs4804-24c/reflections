Overview: Selfiecity provides a visualization of their project which analyzes selfie styles from across the world. 

Reflection: 
	I think that the author does a great job representing a very large amount of data and accounts well for the fact that they are working with pictures rather that data points. One thing I would do to improve this graphic would be to provide all the graphs using the pictures, it is very visually appealing and provides the maximum amount of information needed, and provide a schematic (points over pictures) representation of data since users tend to skim through the article before they get into the details. Schematic representation would account for that relatively short attention span of some users and still deliver a great amount of information. 
	I think that the author did a great job with making the graphic interactive and the supporting text provided all the necessary details for context. I also like that they limited their data outputs to major cities across the world which makes the content a lot more digestible. The fact that all the visualizations were consistent across the different cities made it easy to compare the outputs and get the overall big idea out. Finally, I like that the author provided links to details of the study for those users who would be interested in getting more information. 
	Overall, I one thing I got out of this example was that it is nice to represent the data in an upside down pyramid to tell the story and get more granular for those users that are interested in learning more.
