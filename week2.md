The animated graph that I found represents the volatility of the stock market on a given week in june 4 years ago. I chose this graph for its uniqueness. After looking into it some more, I found that this is called a 'swarm' or 'beeswarm' chart. This chart is great for dense data with the use of animation. For this graph, companies are assigned a bubble and the size of the bubble represents the market cap for the given company. The companies are then split into industry categories and assigned a color. Some of theh big tech companies are given a name and you can see that the bigger companies tend to remain in the positive volatility. This visualization was created by the company chartfleau using d.3. They've created an app with this visualization technique in order to help individuals analyze their portfolio more easily. I think that this type of gragh would have lots of good use cases outside of stocks. I'd be really interested in finding out how they created this graph in d3 and trying to replicate it.
