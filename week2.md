Week 2 Visualization:

https://rocketleague.tracker.network/rocket-league/distribution?playlist=11

This visualization shows a bar chart of the amount of people in each of the ranks in a popular video game, Rocket League.
This bar chart shows the ranks in an increasing order on the x-axis, and the percentage of total players in that rank on the y.
Also, there is a dropdown at the top that allows you to change the graphs for each of the three ranked gamemodes; 1v1, 2v2, and 3v3.
One thing I like about this graph is that when you hover over each of the bars, it tells you the percentage of total players in that rank, and the number.
One thing that I dislike about this chart is that as you get towards the top or bottom of the ranks, the bars become very small and hard to hover over.
I would change this by making the y axis the total number of players in that rank in thousands, and that would allow the smaller bars to have a larger representation on the graph.
Along with the bar chart is a table on the bottom that allows users to see the mmr(match-making rating) that they need to get to to reach that specific rank.
I use this chart at least once a week in order to see how many games I need to win to rank up, and also how I stack up against the competition.
