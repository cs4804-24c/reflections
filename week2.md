This site holds thousands of selfies, and lets you filter through characteristics while also seeing how the distribution is set for each. Features range from statistical information, to appearance, to perceived mood. The two most noticeable features are the interactive ability and how there are different methods of visualization to best represent the different data features. For example, there is a map with circles and the radiusâ€™ are representative of the number of selfies from that region. You can also combine filters, ranging from open/closed mouths and eyes, to age and region. This helps you to see different correlations between features. While this may not be an intended feature, the filters allow you to see the success of how the features are determined by the system. There may be some mistakes when you see a photo that does not belong to the system that can be seen because it returns the faces that belong to the filter you selected. If you click on yes for glasses, there are some people who are not wearing glasses. Still, the distributions change according to the filters you apply which is a helpful tool in visualization.
