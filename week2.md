For this weekâ€™s reflection, I chose to focus on a piece from Our World in Data. This article and visualization focus on the life expectancy from all over the world in years 1800, 1950, and 2015. The visualization uses colors to group different levels of age expectancy, following a rainbow pattern. This makes the graphic easily interpretable and comparable to previous years. 

The data visualization illustrates a historic leap, from universal short lifespans in 1800, where the expected age was 29, to today's global average of over 72 years. This positive trajectory, impacting every region, reflects the impact of sustained health progress. The visualization is a testament to the remarkable possibilities and encourages further efforts to address remaining health inequalities worldwide.
