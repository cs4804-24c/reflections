This past week, one visualization that caught my eye was that found at the following link:
https://cosmos-book.github.io/human-spaceflight/index.html

An important detail to mention is that the axes of this visualization are customizable, leading to a total of 72 different
possible graphs based on the options listed on the dropdowns alone. The individual dots represent US astronauts, cosmonauts,
taikonauts, and other miscellaneous spacefarers. Apart from position on the plot, however, the dots contain additional
information based on how they are colored: Vermillion red for cosmonauts; cool green for international astronauts; sky blue for
US astronauts; saffron yellow for taikonauts; and Rebecca purple for commercial astronauts as well as tourists. If a dot has a
white annulus surrounding it, that means that the person it is supposed to represent is currently in space. Even if not
intentional, I found the color scheme especially fascinating, given the subliminal meanings behind each specific choice of color.

The most obvious example of this is represented in the red dots symbolizing cosmonauts, as red is typically a color used in the
political sphere to signify Communism and its proponents. Though Russia is no longer a Communist nation, its history as
well as staunch legacy as one justifies its choice of color. The choice of green for representing international astronauts may
instead signify harmony and unity as it does in many cultures and traditions, which is consistent with themes of cooperation,
beneficence, and amity among different nations and foreign lands. Blue is typically associated with freedom and, especially in
American usage, vigilence, so it would be fitting to use it to symbolize stereotypical conceptions of US life as well as national
ethos. Yellow is possibly the most interesting and fitting choice of color to represent Chinese spacefarers, as it has a very long
and deep significance in traditional Chinese philosophy, medicine, religion, and culture. In the Chinese cultural sphere, yellow
symbolizes power and prosperity, along with a balance between Yin and Yang. Hence, the decision to represent the Chinese space
program and those affiliated with it by the color yellow is a sound one. Lastly, purple may possibly be used to represent
commercial and tourist spacefarers because of the images of nobility and luxury it traditionally invokes. Indeed, those who are
able to even afford to privately fund missions or just personal trips to outer space are typically those who have accumulated
enough wealth to do so.
