I found this visualization of somebody's income and expenses. It shows all sources of income, and where that money goes by category. 
It's color coded and has clear sections and labels which is nice. And the Sankey format is appealing and easy to follow. The categories and their subcategories are clear and contribute well to the left-to-right flow of this visualization.
I think a Sankey diagram is a really nice choice for something like this because of how flowy it is. It depicts everything like a stream of water with multiple sources and destinations and it's a very natural way to consume information.
These kinds of diagrams are trending on Reddit right now, and they're getting a bit old but I think this one is pretty cool. I like the ones involving money or the ones about job searches. I think these visualizations are especially cool because they represent how individual people are tracking aspects of their own lives and sharing them in neat and informative ways.
This shows how data visualization can be practical at even a personal level. It inspires me to create similar visualizations to help me better understand and keep track of my own life or whatever else is important to me. I like the idea of having ways to tell myself and others a story through numbers with just one image.
I like the color separation because it makes it easier to read, even though the colors themselves are kind of random.
I also like how the sources of income are grouped separately based on pre and post-tax. It's a small detail and it was kind of confusing at first, but once I understood it things were much more clear and I appreciate it being done that way.
I appreciate the specific values shown on the diagram. I know sometimes people don't like to share those types of details with other people, especially online, but it's useful to gain that sort of perspective on one person's experience in a real-world context, instead of just rough estimates or descriptions.
For some of the lowest-level subcategories, it's a little hard to guess what they refer to. Like Camera, Movies, etc. Though I suppose that's the limitation of stuff like this because I don't want a purchase-by-purchase breakdown or anything. And I think some were clarified in the comments. But still, I think most of the value of this visualization is in the larger categories as they trickle down into the tiny streams, rather than in the endpoints themselves.
Overall I think this is a nice visualization and a fun trend to explore. I hope I'll be able to save as much of my income as this guy does...
