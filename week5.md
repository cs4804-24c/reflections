The article that I linked discusses the importance of visualization in understanding and improving deep learning models, even when considering the democratization of AI
where the development and deployment of neural networks have become more accessible to non-technical individuals. Despite the ease of creating complex models, their 
training and interpretability remain challenging to most individuals without a sufficient CS background. Visualization tools and interactive interfaces a la Tableau 
have been developed to demystify how these models learn and make predictions, helping both developers and end-users.
