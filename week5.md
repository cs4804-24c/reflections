This visual has two horizontal bar charts comparing the most watched TV broadcasts. The visual connects the two metrics using parallel coordinates.

The story that I get from this visual is that despite recent Super Bowls having higher and higher average viewers, this metric can be misleading to how popular the broadcast is in the United States. This message is clear by the parallel coordinates. You can see nearly all the super bowls decrease in rankings when the metric is viewers as a percentage of the population. This is made very clear by the color groups. The red stands out vs the light purple. The red decreasing lines stick out to the viewer, and the group of purple bars in the right group emphasize this. While the most recent superbowl will have a similar number of average viewers, it is not even close to the same percentage of the population that watched the Moon Landing in 1969.

I like how the author was able to fit the exact metric, network, name, and logo of the broadcast while still not making the visual feel cluttered. One thing I don't like is the lowercase names of the metrics, and I do not think the word by is necessary.
