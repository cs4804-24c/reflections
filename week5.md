For this week. I looked at this article from the New York Times https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/09/18/opinion/human-population-global-growth.html?unlocked_article_code=1.H00.oZ1-.-04MAeD35UK1 .
This article was about population decrease and how the human population is expected to peek soon and then decrease. It was a fairly standard
new york times article as it had different visuales as you scrolled down. Nothing realyy stood out as different until I got to a graph type I haven't
realyy seen before that I thought was cool.  The graph was total fertility rates by country vs GPD values. What made this graph special is the
the before and after transition of the point between 2 years 30 years apart. By clicking the button you can see an anmation of the change
and lines that depict the movement of the points from where they started to where they ended. This is a simple concept but I feel like this was 
a very powerfulk technique that really helped the visualization shine through.
