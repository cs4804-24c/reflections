This visualization found on tableau.com by Xinran Peng titled "Data+Movie: Into the Spider-Verse | Iron Viz: Student Edition 2024" is an extremely impressive multilayered visualization discussing everything regarding the Spider-Man superhero cinematic universe. The screenshots attached display how large the visualization is, and almost every element of this visualization is interactive with content. Multiple shapes, graphics, types of graphs, tables, etc, this visualization is the perfect final exam for this course, as it covers every aspect of lecture content that we have covered so far. I find it impressive that the creator was able to integrate so many viz strategies and methodologies into their work and to include animations as well as real-world data (which may be slightly outdated) and images that were easy to understand where placed. My critiques would be many points of redundant data, to many viewers I can see where many would disconnect the Spider-Man media and general animated movie data. Also, there is a lot of information in this visualization, and as I write this reflection I am still uncovering all bits and pieces, which would be too much to even write here. There are times when there can be too much going on, and while I think this visualization is extremely impressive, beyond my abilities, the modern average attention span unfortunately would not comprehend what is being discussed throughout this visualization. The theme and color schema for the layout are beautiful and are in respect with the films they adhere to, and I find the statistics for both the actors and animated films directory to be interesting. As mentioned several times, all non-text and non-background features are interactive, and I am curious as to which library or libraries the creator could have used to create this visualization, and, is it all credited at the source? What about when it needs to be updated? There is a huge influx of information one needs to intake for this visualization, and as time goes on the amount of information will only grow, how can this visualization be more simple? I would say split it up into different sheets, an interactive tab or menu at the top for one to navigate to like its own webpage, as opposed to one long infographic.
