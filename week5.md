Visualization: https://qz.com/296941/interactive-graphic-every-active-satellite-orbiting-earth 
This visualization shows a very unique style that displays satellites distance from earth. It also has information on how much the satellite weighs, 
where the satellite is from, and when it was launched. One cool interactive feature of the graph was that when you hovered over a satellite, it would 
then display information on its age and name as well as visually display how varying distances away from earth the satellite travels. There is also an 
animation feature on the graph that shows the satellite's path during its orbit around the earth. My favorite design on this graph is that it provides 
short descriptions and fun facts about the satellites as you continue to scroll down the visualization. This makes the visualization feel like it's 
telling a story as you continue to explore the website and makes the viewer more interested in what's going on in the visualization. These descriptions 
can also highlight specific information on the graph so that you can better understand what the description is saying about the satellites and it also 
provides useful links to other websites that go further in depth. One aspect of this graph that makes it difficult to visualize is the clusters of 
satellites that are grouped together at certain orbits, making it difficult to view specific satellites. One way to fix this would be having the ability 
to highlight specific satellites that you want to view and hide the other satellites from view. Although they have different ways to color satellites 
based on their characteristics, it would also be helpful to hide satellites from view that you are not interested in. Overall, I think this graph was 
very educational and pretty easy to understand what was going on, however certain parts of the visualization were overcrowded.
