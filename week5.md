Week 5 Reflection:

This data shows the commuting times across different counties in the U.S, and the data was collected back in 2022. The data is represented like a heat map, using different shades of gray, ranging from white to black. That being the darker it is, the longer the average commute is. The graph is also very interactive, which I thought was really helpful in analysing this data set. There is a dropdown to show the top counties and a box and whisker plot which helps so the distribution of the data. In addition, hovering over any point on the box and whisker, or the top counties plot/chart highlights the county on the map. This is extremely helpful, as it gives you an idea of where the county is and maybe make a connection to why the commute might be longer or shorter. From the box and whisker plot we can also see some of the outliers, notably, Mora County in New Mexico. Users can also focus onto a state by selecting it in the drop down, which enhances the user experience. Hovering over a county on the map also gives you the name and the average commute time.

Overall, this graph is done very well. It is clean, simplistic, visually appealing and offers a lot of additional features that enhances the user experience. One way to enhance the graph would be to adding timeline functionality/animation showing the gradual change of average commute times over the span of a couple years. Especially, with the use of the heat map, I am interested to see if there is any significant changes over these past few years.
