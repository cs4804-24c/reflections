This visualization shows the number of years of the median household income to equate to the value of a typical home, for US counties in 2022. It makes really good use of the colors, there is so much contrast between all colors, that you can identify each county despite the two purple-ish shades being close. At the same time, the choice of yellow is a great one because the brightness of the color stands out compared to the mass of purples. It really highlights the fact that the West Coast, the a few exceptions, has much higher housing costs. However, there are a few updates that could be made to make it better. For example, what does the color grey symbolize? It is present in the visualization but not in the legend. Additionally, I think the font choice and word placement could be better. The placement of the text or event and the size of the legend could be made to match the length of the color swabs. I think the top headlining text could be made bigger and with a bit more contrast maybe in the background. The subheading should be bigger, but also I think it could all be justified. Maybe the creator could have added little blurbs that explain or highlight the counties that have the lowest and highest number of years. Additionally, I think the creator could build upon the visualization by adding a somehow interactive element that could maybe show cost of living or taxes.
