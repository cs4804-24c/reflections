<h1>Week 5 Reflection</h1>
<p>Frederica Fragapane recently created a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C2MvgAhNkd5/?hl=en&img_index=1">data visualization</a> to visualize the death toll of Palestinians in the Israel-Palestine conflict over the past 100 days. In the first slide of the visualization, Fragapane uses a branch to represent one day. I believe the branch is an ode to olive branches which is a big part of Palestinian cutlture. On each branch, a black extension of the branch represents an adult killed while a red extension represents a child killed. By presenting this slide first of the singular branch, she provides a legend that provides basis for the larger visualization she creates on the second slide. On the second slide, she presents a branch for every day. All of these branches combine to create a huge sprawling pattern that puts the death toll into perspective. Fragapane visualizes the death toll in a beautiful way relevant to Palestinian culture but due to the magnitiude of the data she is presenting the visualization does get blurred. Due to how big the visualization is on the second slide, it can be hard to see data about each day in the past 100 days. If this was an interactive visualization where viewers could zoom in on the branches and hover on individual branches to view data for that day it may make the visualization more useful.</p>
