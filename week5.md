The visualization I chose this week is a visualization of different country’s plastic waste pollution and how they relate to GDP per capita. I really appreciate the actual amount of information that is on the visualization and how it’s spread out in an organized manner. I like how the whole visualization flows as you read it, starting with an overview, then presenting the data on the countries, and ending with where the plastic ends up. I especially like the chart at the bottom that compares the amount of plastic waste in each ocean by using the average blue whale size. While the whales help to put into perspective, the inclusion of tonnes above help to relate to the first chart in the visualization, which includes the tonnes of plastic waste produced by each country. This gives more perspective as to how much waste is produced and where it ends up. One issue that I do have with it is how it represents the GDP per capita of each country. In the description near the top of the visualization it puts an emphasis on the GDP per capita but in the chart it is quite small and off to the side. Also, it is hard to line up the circles to the countries that they are supposed to represent since there are so many and they are squeezed together, especially as you get farther down. So if that is supposed to be the important takeaway, I have trouble getting much information from that aspect.
