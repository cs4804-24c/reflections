This week I found this spatial data visualization. I find it amazing how these visualizations better help identify who these people are and how they bank. Using the combination of ML and even Uber's H3 
library is amazing. I find these visualizations very easy to understand as an average reader. On top of this, I love how visualizations like this help cities improve their way of life and target problems
that they may be facing. Overall, this from of visualization was very interesting to me and I love seeing how these can have huge impacts on the world.
