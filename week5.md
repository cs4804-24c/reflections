The visualization I chose this week comes from Tableau and is a visualization made by Tanya Lomskaya on their public software. It shows the data for women that were awarded
Nobel Prizes in each of the categories from 1901-present day. The thing that drew me to this visualization was the circular format that the data was presented in. At first, I 
was not sure the reasoning behind this design decision, but I really enjoy that at the end of this circular timeline there are bars that align with each of the categories
showing the total number of women who had been awarded this prize. I really like the color scheme that this visualization uses, and I feel that the colors work well
on the black background. A big feature of this visualization is the use of tooltips to give further information on each female Nobel Prize winner, presenting information
such as country of origin, year of birth, what year and category they won the prize in, and a quote for the reasoning behind their award. I really appreciated this and 
felt like it added a lot to the visualization. However, I do not like that when you mouse over the dots representing male or group awardees, the dot highlights as if it was 
a tooltip, but does not give any information. I think it would be beneficial to make sure you can only mouse over and highlight female awardees. Additionally, the tooltips
also extend to the bars showing the sum of awardees, which I really don't think is necessary, given that there are already numbers at the top of each bar showing the total. 
I also think that the years at the cardinal points of the circle as well as showing the locations of World Wars I and II give good context for the timeline, but I think there 
should be some consistency there. For example, there are years at the north, south, and west points on the circle, however the east point only says World War II. World War
I is located somewhere in the northeastern quadrant. This makes the visualization less visually consistent, which is something I think could be improved.
