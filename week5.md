Visualization Reflection:

In TheUpshot article, "How Much Snow Will Fall Where You Live", authors Aatish Bhatia, Josh Katz, Margot Sanger-Katz, and Samuel Jacoby go into a brief discussion about why snowfall predictions on weather maps often miss; only just a fraction of possible snowfall results are represented in the predictions typically. In the second data visualization titled "Weather Forecastersâ€™ Best Guess", there are some interesting design and technical features that allow for an enjoyable user experience when interpreting and interacting with the map. First, there are three different datasets that the user can switch between (Most Likely, Low End, High End). This dataset selection feature is very beneficial to the user it enables he/her to access the full range of snowfall data that make up the forecaster's best guess. On the map displaying the midwestern United States, any given colored area corresponds to a color on the snowfall legend positioned above the map. This snowfall legend is a great addition to the visualization as it immediately provides the user an idea about how many inches of snow accumulated in a certain area on the map. When a user hovers over any area on the map, there is an interactive tooltip containing the expect snowfall in inches of that area. In particular, a good design decision made here is that the tooltip provides an expected snowfall range (not just a single value), which is true to the way weather forecasters predict snowfall accumulation and also is consistent with the ranges shown on the legend. Lastly, another interactive feature built into this visualization that completes the user experience is the ability to pan the map of the United States. Although the visualization initially shows the midwestern United States, the user can pan the map left, right, up, and down to view snowfall predictions across the entire country. This panning feature is an excellent addition to the visualization and prevents the inconvenience of attempting to fit the map of the entire United States into the viewport (which would inhibit the quality of the user experience as well). Overall, this weather forecast data visualization is well-designed, and for future work, I am curious to see if data can be collected for the numerous parts of this map of the United States that do not display snowfall prediction ranges.
