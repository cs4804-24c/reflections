Week 5 Reflection

This visual is something that i have never seen before where it is a wind map showcaseing the wind rate on the map for each day. The suface wind data comes from the National Digital Forecast Database where it pull the latest weather information about wind speed and maps it on the diagram. It updates every hour to showcase the most accurate data. It even has a gallery to show some on the most interesting patterns. I thought the one from March 27, 2012, this map have top speed of 0.1 mph and average of 11.7 mph. This visual is not the most appealing when it come to color but the black and white constrast brings the point across. There is an ability to zoom into specific cities and find the infformation regarding the wind speed. Though I like the interactivness to show the way the wind was moving and at what speed there would have been a slider to see how it has changed over time. An example would be from 9 AM to 9PM. I noticed Chicago always seem to have a high wind speed based off the map seen in the mapps in the gallery. I think other type of respresentation of the data would have been nice with some context provided. Currently it is just a map and a sourse of the data but other than the map show the wind pattern there is not other weather features that can explain further of what the wind is moving the way it is. There are still quite some inprovemnts needed but as a starting point it is good.
