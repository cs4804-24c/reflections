I like graphs and charts that become more than a fancy spreadsheet to interpret. This data indicates mountain height, so making the changing y-values into the mountain intself lines up very nicely. I like the framing and imagery that it provides. I don't even think this data is very interesting or clear, but that makes it all the more impressive that I'm engrossed with it.
