Collection of visualizations of Dungeons & Dragons 5e (DnD) spells, monsters, and magic items located here: https://victoria.danclan.com/dndspells.html. As someone who knows DnD, these visualizations contain a lot of embedded information, Monsters by challenge rating & creature type perhaps being the most directly useful. Colors, shape, and other features (outlines and hollow circles for example) are used to indicate various properties of what is depicted. In addition, all the elements have a level of interaction in that you can mouse over the shapes to get the spell/monster/item the point represents. It is interesting to note that the visualization was created with Adobe Illustrator and Excel, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript being used to add the interactivity. The connections between points located in multiple areas had to be done by hand and the area formatted to allow for those relationship lines to be drawn. On interactivity, all the visualizations for spells allow filtering by class and all the visualizations for monsters allow for filtering by environment, further improving usability. For someone inexperienced with DnD, the graphs are likely difficult to read, in part due to the density of data points, unfamiliarity with the terms of the game, and the many categories available. In some ways this makes the visualizations closer to informational tools as opposed to educational materials. I'm not sure it is possible to increase the initial readability of the visualization, but I think an improvement that could be made would be to attach pictures to the creature/item being moused over to the tooltips displayed.
