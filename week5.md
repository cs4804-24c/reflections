There are many parts of this visualization that encourage the viewer to look deeper into the subject. For one, there is the simulation that shows riders and drivers which lets you see the volume of traffic. Then there is the graphical representation that shows the difference in wait time to percent idle drivers. Finally there are the straightforward numbers shown that correlate with the graph movement. This creates an engaging graphic with constant moving parts. Additionally, the user can see how a difference in number of drivers changes the scenario. All of this is wrapped up with their main point: Faster pickup times mean more idle drivers. The article is about how Uber keeps drivers motivated to be available even when “idle”, aka not making money. This visualization is able to show the reality of people’s expectations. I would have added a control for rider congestion to better view the visualization.
