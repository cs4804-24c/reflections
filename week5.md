I decided to do my reflection on an interactive graphic that shows where your tax dollars would go into the Federal budget proposed by Obama back in 2016. Upon reviewing the interactive graphic, I found it simple, and fairly straightforward.

The clear organization by color coding, with each major spending category assigned a distinct hue, facilitated easy comprehension of where tax dollars were directed. I also appreciated the inclusion of subcategories within each major expenditure area, denoted by subtle variations in shade, which provided additional detail without overwhelming the viewer. This approach helped to convey the complexity of budget allocations within specific sectors in a manageable manner. 

The notation that the figures represented millions of dollars was a helpful clarification, ensuring that viewers understood the scale of the budget breakdown accurately. This transparency contributed to a clearer understanding of the data presented.

While the interactive budget breakdown provided valuable insights into federal spending priorities, there are a couple of areas where enhancements could have improved the clarity and usability of the visualization. In the last two categories, the limited space led to overlapping subcategories, making it challenging to discern category names and associated figures. A better layout strategy, such as adjusting the spacing or introducing collapsible sections for subcategories, could have mitigated this issue and improved readability. 

Also, even though the visualization offered an overview of budget allocations, incorporating other interactive features such as a zoom feature to see the detailed breakdown for the smaller, less easy to read(currently) categories could have made the visualization better. Also, perhaps some additional explanation of how much of each tax bracketâ€™s money goes into each category could have enriched the user experience.
