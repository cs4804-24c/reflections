This showing of data about the most watched TV broadcasts in history is quite interesting. On the left side we have a sideways bar chart showing the most watched broadcasts by the number of viewers. On the right side we have another sideways bar chart showing the most watched broadcasts by the percentage of the
American Population that watched it. In the center there is a line graph (I think) that connects the rank changes of the popularity of the broadcasts. Its an interesting way to show data since people read (in English) from left to right, however, it doesn't work cross-culturally. If someone's first language read from
from right to left, for example Arabic or Hebrew, they would still get data, but it would be more confusing. Let alone talking about languages that are traditionally read from top to bottom such as Chinese or Japanese. However, the fact that all the link colors are based on the network the show aired on makes it
harder to tell what broadcast is moved where. Additionally, the classification of Football vs Not Football is confusing, admitedly while this came after the superbowl some of the news doesn't make sense being grouped together, Non-Football as a category includes Space Exploration, Politics, Celebrity News, Boxing, 
and TV shows it doesn't make sense to group them all together. However, while the graph can be hard to read it shows some very interesting information. The Superbowl makes up over half of all the most viewed broadcasts on TV. However, if it is used as a metric of the total amount of the population that saw it, the 
superbowl actually isn't the biggest event by the percentage of the population, with the exception of Superbowl XX every other event was more popular nationwide.
