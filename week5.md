Summary: A neat representation of all the pandemics with a supporting article. 

Reflection: I appreciate this graphic since it is very visually appealing thus making the user want to learn more about the topic. I like how they used the principle of leading lines, which is often used in photography, to create a focal point on the most recent pandemics. The high quality graphics of each of the viruses made the graphic even more visually appealing but it was a bit of an odd contrast with the rest of the graphic. On one hand, such high contrast created focal points on each of the viruses and the supporting text. On another hand, however, the high contrast made the rest of the graphic less visually interesting. I appreciated the timelines and all the labels on the sides were very helpful in delivering the information. One interesting addition to the graphic would be to make each pandemic data appear dynamically as the user scrolls through the page similar to what a lot of New York Times articles do. All the supporting graphics below the main one went into a nice amount of detail and offered an alternate view on the data. More specifically, the graphic representing the genders most affected was visually appealing and an interesting way to represent the information. However, it was a bit overwhelming looking at all the same shapes in such a high contrast color scheme.
