This visualizes the day in the life of men vs women, showing what activities people are doing throughout the day, such as traveling or leisure. You can toggle between slow and fast rates of time passing and also pause the playback to see what people are doing at a single time throughout the day.  It's super fun just to watch the visualization play and see which categories have the most people at certain times. From a basic view and preexisting knowledge, I found it surprising to see that more people are working at specific times than traveling, such as at 6:30am, but since it's ambiguous what constitutes works, it could just both remote work or something else (probably the former). Some areas of improvement could be to add visuals or similar things that would help visualize the data better from the start. When first looking at the vis, it's info overload, esp with the amount of data moving around at a fast pace. Maybe restructuring the way the categories are placed would help with that. I think it would also be interesting to see what trends there are, such as if there are many people that do traveling > work > leisure, or some order that is shared among multiple individuals. Another thing could be to visualize M vs F trends, as I would assume there's stuff to analyze there as well. I also think giving some more background data would be very helpful, since just blankly looking at the visualization without understanding what most people are doing at certain times.
