Week 5 Reflection Patrick Salisbury

https://music.ishkur.com/

(Note: ishkur states that this guide is "rated M." Use caution, especially when reading their commentaries on different genres of music. If you stay within the main chart and just listen to songs at most it should not be a problem.)

For this weeks reflection, I chose to talk about one of my favorite sites of all time, ishkur's guide to electronic music. 
This site is a visualization of the genre of electronic music as a whole, and how it has expanded into a huge number of different subgenres over time.
The cool part about this site is that not only does it provide a huge amount of information on the history of electronic music, but it also allows you to listen to selected tracks from the genre over time. This means that you can actively use the site to find new subgenres of music to explore based on both the branch-like evolution of genres and their proximity showing a similar sound as well as by randomly listening around to genres that seem interesting to you or catch your eye.
I really like how you can pan and zoom easily on this visualization. There is so much to explore here that you can spend hours and hours just panning around, reading commentaries on subgenres and listening to the example tracks. 
One thing that I thought could be better is the color schemes. Ishkur says that the color themes are somewhat random, and it shows. It might be cool to do something like having the earliest genres as primary colors and then having them blend together over time as they influence each other.
Also, this is a pretty cluttered visualization especially for someone that is new to electronic music. It might be cool to have something where only the primary genres are shown and then their subgenres show up if you click on that genre and begin to pan and zoom in.
Overall, I would say this visualization does a great job at both educating the viewer on the genres as well as effectively showing how the genres evolved over time, but it is definitely a visualization that you need to put quite a bit of time into to get the most out of.
