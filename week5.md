For this weeks visualizaztion I chose the visualization “How Americans Eat” which  uses data on food data from the USDA to estimate and visualize how Americans eat nationally. The chart above shows how the pounds eaten per year per capita of key sources of protein has changed from 1970 to 2019. I like this visualization as I think it is extremely straightforward and easy to interpret, so much so that I sent it to my parents as I thought they might find it interesting. 

The visualization uses colors similar to that of the protein source they represent, heightening the impact. Additionally, the marker in lbs of consumption per capita carries significant visual weight, actualizing how much the average person consumes. 

I think this visualization is interesting and effective in more than one way, as well as easily understandable for the average person.
