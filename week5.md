A wide range of human emotions can be seen during sport events. Fans experience emotional ups and downs during a game like the joy and excitement of a comeback or the disappointment of a loss. This visualization is the simulation of fan emotions during a basketball game. It shows how emotions differ from two opposing fan groups watching the same math. Across all the people in the stadium, the range of emotions can vary during a game. Two changing parameters in this visualization are time and the points. This simulation takes different times and shows how the range of emotions can change during a game as the points change. Happiness shoes baskets scored and the overall performance of the team. Based on the visualization, when the team is doing well, fans are happier but when the scores are close, they are more excited. As the game gets closer to the end, fans get more excited/anxious especially when the score is close. As this algorithm is calculated for every second of the game, it is highly sensitive to small changes in the scoring change. It is interesting to see how ‘excited’ turns to ‘content’ and ‘nervous’ changes to ‘disappointment’. Different numbers can be plugged into this function to produce different results.
