For this weeks reflection I chose [_Visualizing The Lifespan of Every U.S. President_](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/visualizing-the-lifespan-of-every-u-s-president/) by Jeff Desjardins.

I chose this visualization for two reasons. Firstly, it has been discussed amongst many Americans that the current front running US Presidential candidates are viewed as to old to be the president for 2024-2028. Secondly,
I haven't seen a bar graph setup in this kind of way. I found it interesting that each president had a 3rd categorical variable added by a colored square before the actual bar starts, denoting if they're still alive or how 
they died. As this visualization is a few years old, it doesn't have Joe Biden listed and still has H.W. Bush listed as a living president. Since this visualization is just an image, the user is limited to the view by the author.
It could be interesting if it was made interactive, such as: filtering by still living presidents, cause of death, and sorting them by their life span. Another interesting visualization technique the author uses is highlighting 
part of the bar graph for when each person was the sitting president in the US. This shows if they were elected, young, middle aged or old, as well as if they served out the full term of the presidency. This clearly shows
the short term held by William Henry Harrison and Zachary Taylor, who both died in office. Finally, this graph also shows how modern presidents are living longer than their counterparts from over 100 years ago. Many of the 
presidents before Herbert Hoover had a much lower average life expectancy, where as those after have been living much longer, many past the age of 80, most likely because of advances in healthcare.
