This is a bar chart race that I found showing the popularity of music genres from 1910 - 2019. I found it interesting that all the way up until the 2000's there was always a few genres that dominated for different areas. For example all the way from 1916 - 1933 country dominated with over 50 percent of the market for some time. Then Jazz explodes in 30s an completely overtakes country music all the way up until 1945. So from 1916 to about 1950 all two genres of music dominated the market. Once the 50s hit genres seem to equalize a little bit but not fully. Then in 1955 rock in roll takes over but only breifly for 5 years. Once the 90s hit you start seeing lots of electrinic genres start to become popular. This is also when the spread of popularity between genres begins to equalize much more. After that there isnt a genre that takes more than 16 percent of the market. Overall I thought this visualizition did a good job of explaining the data effectively.
