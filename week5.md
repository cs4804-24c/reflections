Wikipedia's Lamest Edit Wars
https://informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/wikipedia-lamest-edit-wars/

Reflection:

David McCandless created a nice tree map visualization about wikipedia edits.
The tree map is sorted by size, top left being the least amount of edits and the bottom right being the most amount of edits.
The minimum edits on the visualization is 1000, with the most being 29,0000.
You can filter by certain categories such as Animals, Ethics, Religion, etc.
A couple issues I had with the visualization is that it wasn't sorted by categories like a typical tree map.
Another issue I had was the lack of information.
I would prefer if I could interact and click the differnt rectangles to pull up that specific wiki page.
As it currently stands, theres the title of the wiki page with a description of the edits happening.
The description is a bit confusing cause some of them are jokes and some others are just blank.
Overall I find it amusing that the most edits come from Wikipedia's Wikipedia page.
