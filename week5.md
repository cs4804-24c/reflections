Reflection: 
This week I found an article creating different data visualizations for Rachel Lindsey's season of The Bachelorette. I 
thought these were really fun and engaging visualizations as someone who watches The Bachelorette. I  am going to talk 
about two different visualizations found on the website. The first one is "A look back at all the good times." I really 
liked the color choices used because I think they promote the correct feelings visually when looking at them. The pink 
feels like calm, the hot pink gives the sense there is more emotion there (which is why they got an advanced rose that 
week), and the gray is empty feeling because they are no longer on the show. I  also like the comments added in about 
each of the contestants. I feel like they make the visualization extra engaging and funny if you are caught up on the 
current bachelorette season. I think the elimination rate by week added on the bottom of the visualization is also 
helpful to help track the progress of the season weekly. The next visualization I want to talk about is "Who spent the 
most time with Rachel Lindsey." I thought the use of the contestants faces throughout the visualization made the vis 
extra engaging, but also made it very difficult to figure out the data. For the contestants that you cannot make out 
their face, you don't really know which contestants data you are looking at. I think it would have been helpful if for 
the small bar sections they found a way to attach their name to the image or provide a key. I also really liked how the 
images of the contestants that got eliminated that week are black and white because it gives you a sense of time spent
with the bachelorette and how that correlates to making it to the next week. I again thought the funny notes added in 
on top of the data made the vis extra engaging. I do wish the vis extended to the end of the season instead of stopping 
at week 8. Even if time spent between the contestants and the bachelorette was equal at that point, I think it would 
be nice to see all the data. The vis feels sort of unfinished without the rest of the season.
